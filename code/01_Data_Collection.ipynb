       "  'selftext': 'So I’ve got a friend who runs a small-scale (about 30 head), local, organic cattle operation.  While the cows are still being raised for beef, they’re kept on grass their whole lives, never eat grain, calves are with mothers until going to butcher, and the animals are treated with (IMO) as much respect as possible, given the circumstances.  My friend also uses a FDA/Organic (idk all the govt. terminology) approved butcher.  Apparently, the butcher uses reduced-stress means of killing.  My friend’s view on his role in society is this: if people still consume meat (and will do so for the foreseeable future), then they might as well get it from a good source (whatever the definition of “good” is).  What are y’all’s opinions/thoughts on this ideology?  \\n\\nNote: I’m not trying to force an argument/opinions on anyone, just thing to start a conversation.  Also, if this question has already been posed, I apologize.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Basically I picked some vegan kimchi out of the vegan section from a brand that generally advertises itself as vegan. I then went back to the same section and brand and swapped flavors because i changed my mind and wanted a spicier flavor. I didnt check the new flavors label. (Big mistake on my end apparently) I went home and made some ramen and added the kimchi, ate it, and then checked the label to see how much alcohol from fermentation there was in the product. (im on a strict no alcohol medication) Anyway I see shrimp and anchovy sauce listed as ingredients!!!! What the F***!!!!! Ive been throwing up my dinner for over 30 minutes now because I cant get the thought of dead baby shrimp and anchovy’s in my body out of my head. How is this even allowed!!!!!! Never again will i not check a label. :( (Sorry if this is semi incoherent Im typing this in a sick fit of rage)',\n",

With years of therapy trying to be better at trying new foods, I'm finally making some headway and it's really exciting. I tried making pizza with vegan cheese. I chose a brand specifically that is supposed to melt well because texture is extremely important. I will throw up and cry if it's the wrong texture. But when I made it, instead of melting it just... hardened? :/ everyone says it's stretchy and gooey so I did something wrong? I just made it the same way I made animal abuse pizza.

I made the decision right there to at least go vegetarian with vegan being the ultimate goal. I haven\\\\`t completely cut out eating cheese yet. I eat it when I start to feel really low on energy but I don\\\\`t like doing this. Cheese is the last thing holding me back from being purely vegan as far as diet goes.  This is also partially a compromise with others who insist on cooking for me but constantly ask things like well fish is okay right? How about chicken? That\\\\`s not red meat at least? Ect.. \\n\\nI immediately recognized some benefits in my health that I didn\\\\`t anticipate that I want to hold on to. I had an immediate reduction of chronic constipation and I also realized that my breathing cleared up as it has been really bad ever since I caught the COVID last summer. Cutting out milk really helped the breathing especially I think. I also have arthritis diagnosed and some joint issues, that have been helped by changing to this diet which I think reduced inflammation in my body.\\n\\n Because I am trying to negate the constipation, I have a small set of meals that I eat listed above. I am having some energy and motivation and focus issues (partially lingering from COVID but also from my new diet). I think this is not a very balanced diet and I would like to know any of your opinions on things I should add/subtract to give me more energy and improve my focus and motivation as I think I\\\\`m lacking in some things. I take vitamin b-12 supplements here and there, but a vegan specific multivitamin would be helpful I think. I just don\\\\`t know what would be a good one and couldn't find any at CVS.  I bought some vegan cookbooks but still don\\\\`t really know which meals I need to make to be more balanced.\\n\\n# TLDR: Plz Help me to vegan better. I`m scared of getting constipated more so I don`t give myself enough variety in my meals and I get tired and unmotivated.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TW: Animal abuse. TL;DR\\n\\n&gt;!Grew up in the pet industry, always \\'loved animals\\', went to college and studied environmental conservation, realized that the pet industry is shit, all the while flirting with veganism, until poor health led me into veganism, the vegan diet improved my health, further engagement with philosophy/ethics and exposure to animal suffering drove the point home to where I am now permanently stuck as a vegan and really annoying about it.!&lt;\\n\\nThe truth is inevitable and will keep coming back regardless how hard you try to suppress it.\\n\\nI grew up in what is widely considered a very \"animal loving\" household. My parents were involved in the pet industry, eventually owning their own business, and that\\'s where I worked before I was even a teenager. As a result, my entire childhood was defined by being surrounded by and appreciating animals, from dogs and cats to caiman, parrots, and stingrays and everything in between. \\n\\nBut there was always something a little odd about things. Being a child and being surrounded by the casualties of the pet industry, the dead fish, the feeder mice and rats, it never sat as well with me as it did for other people in my family. There was always the sense of dread and the dissonance when entering the room full of \\'feeders\\' -- the contrast between the cuteness of the baby rats, the \\'pinkies,\\' and what was to become of them. \\n\\nSome people prefer buying frozen feeder rodents, and when we were out of them, someone had to make more by killing them and freezing them. This was a task that was always something I refused to do, but my sibling was almost eager to do so and saw it as no big deal. So he\\'d take the babies and whack them against the side of a table until they were dead and then freeze them. It always made me shudder.\\n\\nBeing a huge computer nerd as well, I also ran the company website and was uniquely exposed to these emails we would get from animal rights activists threatening us over the treatment of certain animals. They sort of piqued my interest because I was not expecting this reaction. To me and my family, we were always very ethical in how we approached the pet industry, we thought. We took extra care to not sell animals to questionable people. No rabbits during Easter. We didn\\'t even sell low quality dog and cat food. We educated customers on how to be responsible pet owners. If someone didn\\'t seem responsible, we reserved the right to refuse to sell to them, and we did that more often than you might expect. \\n\\nOccasionally as a teenager I would go through these efforts to cook vegan meals sometimes. My mom would help me, being a mom, but not particularly interested in the food itself. Nevertheless, eating less meat just seemed like a thing I\\'d do occasionally. The truth of not harming animals seemed apparent to me but didn\\'t really culminate into veganism until much later. Eating meat was just something everyone did without questioning it, and giving that up seemed essentially impossible.\\n\\nEventually I grew up and went off to college, and partly because I\\'d always been interested in animals, I decided to study environmental conservation. And it was through these college courses that, for the first time in my life, I was really faced with the totality of the negative consequences of the pet industry on the environment. It did not take much to break me away from the illusion that my parent\\'s pet business was something that was good for animals. It was clearly not. I\\'d think back to my time in Florida, my parents selling exotic snakes to strangers, and fast forward to the present moment when Florida is overran with non-native snakes. I\\'d think of all the exotic animals and wonder where we were actually getting them from, if they were truly captively bred, and to what extent any of these sources were truly reliable. There were no good answers there.\\n\\nOne of my favorite subjects in college was animal behavior. I loved learning about the interesting ways that animals are more intelligent and more capable than humans have previously gave them credit for. I\\'d inform my brother of this stuff, but he\\'d always mock the notions of non-human animals being intelligent or worthy of consideration. Meanwhile, my brother being grown now as well, had developed a hot head, a quick temper, and would routinely get into violent clashes with people. As I sit back and reflect on all of it, I wonder to what extent I could have seen that coming given his attitude towards animals as a child, and I wonder to what extent the need to kill animals contributed to that mindset or if it was something that was just always a part of him.\\n\\nSo now I\\'ve been a college graduate for a while. I\\'ve always basically accepted vegan ethics but made various rationalizations or excuses for continuing to consume animal products. It just didn\\'t seem like a thing that was possible to give up... until I decided to actually try it. I finally became an adult, completely financially independent, and decided to challenge myself to be vegan for 30 days. Just 30 days, I told myself, and I\\'d see if it was possible, and then I could go back to eating the foods that I grew up enjoying.\\n\\nThe 30 days went by fast, and I was surprised at how easy everything was. I didn\\'t even miss meat that much, really. I especially didn\\'t miss milk in the slightest. I missed cheese more than anything, but it wasn\\'t that big of a deal. The 30 days turned into like 50 days before I decided to end the challenge.\\n\\nAfter that point, I had went travelling all over the United States for a couple years. Living life always on the move meant not being able to prepare food for myself, and so I became reliant on other people cooking for me, on junk food, etc. It was easy to slide back into old ways of consumption. \\n\\nThen COVID came, and I took that as an excuse to not exercise as much. Eventually it struck me, and I recovered, but it seemed to fuck with my gastrointestinal system or at least trigger something that was coming soon anyway. My health was deteriorating. The way that I felt after eating was markedly worse. This GI problem lingered for the better part of a year. And with all that time being spent cooped up in the house due to COVID, I started to become interested in ethics and philosophy and began exposing myself to some nuanced arguments in favor of veganism.\\n\\nEventually I saw a doctor, and we decided to try some supplements and change some things. I voluntarily said that I had been experimenting with a vegan diet in the past and would try that again.  We opted for this lifestyle change first instead of prescription drugs. \\n\\nI immediately saw improvement with the way my body was reacting after switching to a vegan diet. Previously, when I would eat an omni diet, everything would feel so heavy, and I could just feel my gut struggling after meals (even before COVID), but this pretty much doesn\\'t happen to me on my vegan diet.\\n\\nBut just exposing myself to the vegan community, to vegan ethics -- exposing myself to the realities of the animal industry -- that\\'s what really finally drove the point home for me. I used to always shut off those vegoon propaganda videos that show me animals being tortured. \"I don\\'t need to see this. I already understand that it is wrong. What\\'s the point? Just to make myself feel bad?\" No, I needed to sit down, watch it, to absorb it, to allow myself to fully realize what\\'s going on and how bad it is, to stop alienating myself from animals and their suffering.\\n\\nThere was some lingering rationalizations, some apologism. I\\'d argue some nuanced points to ethicists to try to ground my perspectives and allow them to correct me, which they did more often than not.\\n\\nNow I\\'m at a point where I understand the gravity of the situation, how mistreated animals are, how I need to avoid products of their abuse beyond just diet, and I understand the philosophical/ethical arguments. I really think there\\'s no going back from here.\\n\\nAnd now my parents are entering retirement, their final years. They\\'re not in good health. My veganism creates incredible defensive reaction and cognitive dissonance in them. I\\'ve previously mentioned to them the ways that the pet industry harms the environment. They don\\'t really engage with it too much. I think they know, deep down, and they don\\'t want me to tell them. And I don\\'t want the final years with them to be me telling them their whole life has been a sort of mistake or a lie. They do genuinely like animals, they\\'re just so wrapped up in \\'the way things have always been.\\' I don\\'t have it in me to preach to them.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Now I’m not vegan yet (freegan best describes myself at the moment, and I may stay that way for a while as it appears more morally and environmentally friendly than veganism, and I’m not living independently yet), but I’m working my way to it; who would’ve thought it required so much inside knowledge of each and every product I use regularly?!\\n\\nThat aside, while neither of my parents (especially my father) have the drive to go vegan (and they even watched Dominion), which has kinda annoyed me as I’m currently around them 24/7, I think I know why this is.\\n\\nDuring an excursion to Oklahoma to see the estate my late grandmother left behind to us via inheritance, I got to experience lower-class country life firsthand in the town of Okmulgee. Many of the citizens didn’t wear masks around other people (Oklahoma had a mask lift ala Texas) and were highly religiously devoted, horses were tamed via machine, and animal agriculture was prevalent. One of my dad’s first cousins had to move here from California due to COVID restrictions giving him far more trouble finding a job, and I felt bad for his situation and other citizens’. It was the first time I genuinely found myself empathizing with poor people. Another one of his cousins led us to another one of the left-behind estates, which included a small open field with two horses, one of which was rideable. He then told me he was going to bring one of them to be bred for another riding horse (I was pretty disgusted by that, but didn’t tell it to his face). That aside, while my dad didn’t live here, it was where his grandmother lived, and he visited this place relatively often as a child (he was born in 1967). He is a hardcore meat-eater (especially beef and pork), though he’s allergic to fish. He also barbecues a lot.\\n\\nRemember [these](https://old.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mu3oqz/very_little_is_known_from_my_perspective_but_its/) [pictures](https://old.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mu5zb9/yet_another_experience_around_an_area_associated/) I posted two days ago? Both of these come from the aforementioned town, which I now dub a MAGA hicktown (there was even a MAGA Trump billboard while my family was on the road).\\n\\nAs for my mother, I don’t know enough about her background to make an informed hypothesis, though I do know that she is aware of how cruel and how much of a disastrous environmental hazard factory farming, and she was speaking of wanting to give up red meat, as she knows of how bad it is for one’s health (though she’s evidently done a pretty poor job of it). She also told me she could be willing to go vegetarian, but she considers veganism to be too extreme despite me trying to tell her that it’s really easy to go these days. Another thing she’s done is grate on me for being too cynical and negative since coming out as an atheist, something that coincided with many transition to vegetarianism, but I make it clear that I find these stances far more progressive and rational then hers despite my respect for the fact that she has hers (not the meat-consuming stance (it’s rooted in traditional appeal and natural appeal), but certainly the religious one). That said, in her defense, I will say I’ve certainly been too much of both, and I’ll admit I haven’t really done a good job at being a positive advocate for both positions. I’m rarely around to advise them, sometimes I seem to belittle too much, and the products I purchase (either with my parents’ money or my own, mostly the latter at this point) are quite expensive (stuff like certain meat substitutes, Daiya cheese (anyone know of a suitable substitute that’s both cheap and more healthy, or could I get cheese for free at a farmer’s market considering my current freeganism?), etc.), and I’m trying to change that while also accounting for my peanut allergy (and trying to avoid other tree nuts along the way).\\n\\nWhat I do know from my mom’s side of the family is that one of her brothers (who’s also my favourite uncle) has actually made quite a few commitments to try out at least going vegetarian, even showing a screenshot of a vegan dinner to me. Considering both this and her willingness to give up red meat, it leaves me the slightest bit hopeful that she’ll go at least vegetarian (or maybe pescatarian as she still eats seafood quite a bit, and there is at least viable nutrition in that product (HDL cholesterol and omega 3)) before the age of 60 (I’ll be almost 30 by that point).\\n\\nAs for my dad and both of their stances on animals, I don’t know what to do. Both he and my mom showed interest in the horse taking in the image above and even a rodeo stadium, while I was repulsed. When I showed them what horses in the Kentucky Derby, I urged them to think of the consequences of paying to go to the derby (especially my dad, who’s a Derby representative), while my mom tried countering back telling me that the horses there are treated well despite the evidence I had at my disposal (though to give her the benefit of the doubt, she hasn’t showed me any evidence towards the horses being treated well, and I may be wrong and have acted too hastily). What do you think I should do from here? I don’t want to end up being too pushy and forcing them to quit cold turkey, not only because I want to be more considerate to my parents, but also because I don’t want to come off as a hypocrite.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So, while I work, I tend to have Youtube playing in the background on autoplay because I have deep anxiety issues and sometimes the noise helps. Please forgive the following if it\\'s a repost of some sort.\\n\\nAnyway, a Vox video comes on discussing the best diets you can have to lower your impact on the environment. They briefly say something like: \"Sure veganism is the best for reducing your carbon footprint, but it\\'s basically the same as vegetarianism. Then they show graphs showing that vegetarianism is about two times as environmentally impactful, but whatever, it\\'s relative to meat consumption. Vegetarianism is still exponentially better than being an everyday meat eater, sure, no quarrels.\\n\\nHowever, the video goes out of its way to say that no one is asking people to give up meat, that would be craaaazy. So the real thing you do, is just cut your meat consumption to the doctor recommended 4 ounces per meal and BAM! WORLD IS SAVED. Meanwhile, they note the Mediterranean diet and how it\\'s mostly plant based. That diet is still many, many times more impactful on the diet than veganism. 4 ounces of meat a day is many many more impactful than the Mediterranean diet.\\n\\nClearly there is something fucky afoot here with the Vox video. Someone with more time to dig than me will probably know. Veganism is made as a brief aside and it\\'s put in this condescending, \"You\\'d have to be a radical loony tune to be a vegan\" kind of way, despite the video demonstrating that veganism is well beyond the best diet (not to mention the larger implications of not objectifying animals for raw \"goods,\" for example, destroying their autonomy and quality of life for bullshit material \"goods\") for the environment. Why would they not make veganism and vegetarianism corner stones of a video discussing the best diets for the environmentally conscious? Veganism is beyond better for the environment than any other diet, yet it\\'s relegated to an obligatory call out and condescension.\\n\\nAny thoughts on this? Am I insane for reading conspiracy in an otherwise fine video?',\n",

I knew that when I originally started on my vegan journey that I would experience bloating and very smelly flatulence due to my decision to go “cold turkey”. But 2 years later, while I have loved the experience and have seen countless benefits, I still face horribly smelling flatulence. My roommate has been super understanding of my situation but I can’t seem to figure out why my gas smells so putrid. It is becoming unbearable for me and  quite frankly embarrassing. I try to hold it in for the sake of the people around me but this often leads to stomach pain/discomfort. I’m looking for advice on possible supplements/methods to improve my situation?

       "  'selftext': '**Introduction**\\n\\nSentience is the capacity to be aware of feelings and sensations, and is sometimes used interchangeably with \\'self-awareness\\', or \\'consciousness\\'. The sentience of many animal species has been overlooked and neglected for much of history and this trend continues to this day. This post hopes to address this by highlighting some lesser known facts about the behaviour and sentience of various different animals, especially those that are routinely exploited or killed for human consumption.\\n\\nWhat traits or properties do humans have that grant them sentience and moral rights? Is it emotions? The ability to think? Behaviours? Being able to breathe? Consciousness? The ability to feel pain? The desire to live? What traits or properties do dogs have that grant them sentience and moral rights, and how are these fundamentally any different from a pig, cow, sheep, goat, chicken, or fish?\\n\\nWhat vegans want more than anything, is not for people to give up meat, eat more carrots, or stop going to the circus; what we want is for nonvegans to realise, appreciate and respect the sentience of other animals to a satisfactory degree. If they are able to do that, then it is very likely that they will do the aforementioned things.\\n\\nFor many thousands of years, humans have been unfairly grouping animals into categories of arbitrary moral worth, i.e the ‘scapegoat’ and the ‘sacred’. For example, cats were worshipped in ancient Egypt, cows are seen as sacred in India, and typically dogs are favoured in Western countries. Conversely, Japan has hunted whales for many centuries, bulls are tortured in Spain, and both dogs and cats are eaten in China. It is time to end this arbitrary discrimination, and try to treat animals more fairly and equally. Similar to racism, and sexism, legalised speciesism will one day become a thing of the past and future generations will look back in dismay.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Pigs 🐷**\\n\\n* Pigs are said to be as intelligent as dogs. \\\\[**Source**: [www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/are-pigs-intelligent\\\\_n\\\\_7585582](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/are-pigs-intelligent_n_7585582)\\\\]\\n* Scientists confirm pigs feel empathy. \\\\[**Source**: [https://mercyforanimals.org/scientists-confirm-pigs-feel-empathy](https://mercyforanimals.org/scientists-confirm-pigs-feel-empathy)\\\\]\\n* Thinking Pigs: A Comparative Review of Cognition, Emotion, and Personality in Sus domesticus. \\\\[**Source**: [https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&amp;context=acwp\\\\_asie](https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&amp;context=acwp_asie)\\\\]\\n* Pigs show potential for \\'remarkable\\' level of behavioral, mental flexibility in new study. \\\\[**Source**: [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub\\\\_releases/2021-02/f-psp020321.php](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/f-psp020321.php)\\\\]\\n* There are numerous stories of pigs saving or helping humans: [\\\\[1\\\\]](https://www.sunnyskyz.com/blog/1554/This-Pot-Bellied-Pig-Played-Dead-To-Save-Her-Dying-Owner) [\\\\[2\\\\]](http://time.com/2852984/hero-pig-saves-family-from-fire/) [\\\\[3\\\\]](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2912193/Saving-owner-s-bacon-17-stone-pot-bellied-pig-scares-burglars-attempted-raid-home.html)\\n* More Pig facts: [https://www.facebook.com/ForgottenVoicesScott/photos/a.111095750496930/113542273585611](https://www.facebook.com/ForgottenVoicesScott/photos/a.111095750496930/113542273585611)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Cows** 🐮\\n\\n* Cows show excitement when they discover how to open a gate leading to a food reward. \\\\[**Source**:\\xa0[www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/animal-sentience/](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/animal-sentience/)\\\\]\\n* Cow intelligence &amp;

The charity Apopo, working with the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania, trains rats to react to the scent of explosives, enabling them to detect landmines in countries including Tanzania, Mozambique and Cambodia. The detection of landmines is usually an expensive business, and countries often lack the resources to carry out the time-consuming and complicated work. A human using a metal detector would take 25 hours to search a 200-sq-m area - a rat can do the same work in 20 minutes. Apopo\\'s James Pursey explains that not only are rats cheaper than dogs, they are also light enough that they don\\'t set off the landmines.”  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;“And it\\'s not just landmines. Rats can also smell out the odour specific to tuberculosis. Every year, three million people infected by TB go undiagnosed and therefore do not receive the care they need. Apopo say that their trained rats can screen 100 samples in 20 minutes - a task that would take a lab technician four days. The samples detected by rats are then rechecked using World Health Organisation (WHO) endorsed confirmation tests.”  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;“Not only can they help clear mines rats, their owners will tell you, also make good pets. Pets4Homes points out that contrary to their reputation rats are clean animals and spend more time grooming themselves than cats. Rachel Heaton is the publicity officer for Yorkshire Rats Club and an owner of 15 rats. She told the BBC that: \"Rats are so affectionate and so in tune with their owners\\' emotions.\" \"When I had my appendix out one of my rats could sense I was unwell and instead of trying to play as he usually does he sat quietly licking my hand.\" \"You can also teach them to do tricks - there is one woman who taught her rat to fetch her a tissue every time she sneezed.”” \\\\[**Source**: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42708127](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42708127)\\\\]\\n\\n* Rats can be taught to play hide and seek -- and they squeal with joy when they win, scientists have found. \\\\[**Source**: [https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/13/europe/rats-hide-seek-intl-scli-scn/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/13/europe/rats-hide-seek-intl-scli-scn/index.html)\\\\]\\n* Meta-cognition in Rats - \\\\[**Video**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEs532C8NFw&amp;t=7m37s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEs532C8NFw&amp;t=7m37s)\\\\]\\n* Rats avoid actions that will hurt others – even if it earns them a treat. \\\\[**Source**: [https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/rats-avoid-actions-that-will-hurt-others-even-if-it-earns-them-a-treat/](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/rats-avoid-actions-that-will-hurt-others-even-if-it-earns-them-a-treat/)\\\\]\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Other**\\n\\n* **Ravens** \\\\- Common ravens have been observed calling wolves to the site of dead animals.

We live on a corner in an area with wild turkeys, and people fly around our corner because there is no stop sign. There was a group of ~5 turkeys in the middle of the road at the corner, and my mom with so much concern was genuinely afraid someone would come around the corner and hit them/hurt them/kill them. While she’s eating turkey.... like you’re SO close!!! \\n\\nAnother regularly says people who abuse animals (aka dogs..) should be shot 0.0 \\n\\nAnd then this weekend, the comment that inspired the post. We were commenting on how it’s funny that people in our neighborhood see the same people walking, and always notice if they don’t have their dog with them when they usually do, or if they don’t see the owner and dog out for a while, people get concerned that something happened to the dog. My sibling just goes “it’s so funny how people are so connected to animals and so concerned for animals that their first thought is to ask about the dog rather than the person when they haven’t seen them for a bit”. YES. EXACTLY. People inherently care about animals? Why is it so much of a stretch to expand that care beyond dogs and cats? So close.. yet so so far. They ordered a chicken sandwich shortly after the comment. \\n\\nI love my family. And they do care - no one wants to see animals hurt or suffering. But my goodness, it’s just... it’s like they need one more push. But I say NOTHING because I’m the “preachy vegan” of course. \\n/rant',\n",

The safest way is to find vitamins that specifically say VEGAN which i now have learned.  \\n\\n\\nI mean i guess i cant say im surprised when plant based just means it contains plants but could have dead carcass in there as well.

I've recently been making the transition to veganism and noticed that a lot of recipes don't call for sugar (I understand why), but instead call for maple syrup or agave nectar. I don't understand why I've never seen a modern cookbook calling for corn syrup! After all, it is just a form of sugar and it is a liquid sweetener just like the other two.\\n\\nMy problem is that maple syrup has a distinct taste that I don't always want in that recipe, and I have concerns with agave as it's imported and it's harvesting has been known to cause harm to bats, my favorite animal. \\n\\nNow, before you say that corn syrup is unhealthy: of course it is. It's liquid sugar. But so are agave and maple... Right? Are there nutritional benefits I didn't know about? Is corn syrup somehow not vegan? Please advise. :)\",\n",

Of course at family mealtimes they eat their meat products, and while it's sad to see I'm so used to horror content that it's not disturbing at all. However, when they eat lamb or veal, they're not just eating a slaughtered animal; they're eating a slaughtered *baby*. I know better than anyone that cognitive dissonance is hard to escape, but to know that it allows them, my *parents*, to eat an innocent young creature... I can't help but be disturbed. It makes me wonder, if it were socially acceptable to slaughter and eat me, would my parents, the ones who are supposed to love and care for me, support it so they could enjoy the taste of my meat? I'm not saying my parents are bad people. I just worry that if cognitive dissonance allows the loving parent of a child to eat the flesh of a baby from another species, it could allow for much worse. I worry for the future of a world where this level of cognitive dissonance is the mainstream.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I live in New Zealand and just left a Thai restaurant that I have frequented for years. They know us by name and we have spent thousands of dollars there over the years. We only order dishes marked with a V for vegetarian. And additionally we always stress that we are strict vegetarians and that they leave out any fish, oyster sauce, or egg, just in case. Tonight we found out that they have all along been using chicken stock in their dishes. We were really upset but tried to respectfully explain to them that a vegetarian would never expect that anything marked as “vegetarian” would have chicken stock. But they wouldn’t even apologize. They started by saying “it’s not chicken, it’s chicken stock” and that “most vegetarians don’t mind a little chicken stock”, and when I tried to make it clear that this is not the case, they tried to somehow justify it by telling us that we’ve been “eating chicken stock in their food for years”, as if this made it ok. Long story short, they wouldn’t take any responsibility for it. No apology, no refund, and they basically said if we are vegan they can’t serve us because all of their food has chicken stock in it. \\n\\nLike many, my veganism is just about a religious thing. I could have chalked it up to ignorance had they apologized. But the fact that they took no responsibility, nor gave any interest in changing their labels, makes me furious and I’d like to take action if that’s possible.\\n\\nDo I have any legal rights here or grounds to sue for emotional damage? My daughter is in tears (as she has never knowingly eaten meat in her entire life) and this is the second time in a week a restaurant has given her a dish with meat in it. This really upsets me and I wonder how many other vegetarians have eaten chicken at this restaurant, assuming the food was vegetarian? Thousands, I’m sure.\\n\\nAny advice?',\n",

What are watch outs when I do meet with a dietician? For example from reading this sub I know that not getting enough protein is a myth and if they bring that up they probably aren’t the right fit.

I did go and the family accepted me to an extent, whilst also showing off pictures of all the wild boar and deer they have hunted and teasing me during dinner. Anyway, after spending so many hours of my life learning this god-forsaken tongue I would really like to get to a point where I actually feel like I can have a conversation with someone and that it hasn't all been for nought. On the other hand, am I ever going to be able to happily live in France? I would love to live in a foreign country but it really seems like they are too far behind the times for it to be a viable option for a vegan person. I love the process of learning languages, I studied French and Latin at school but neither have ever had any practical value to me, should I just quit and start over with a language from a more vegan country, German perhaps?\",\n",

I feel like they are definitely getting the short stick in terms of crumbs to live off of after my generation and those before me are gone.\\n\\nEveryone seems to have this \"all or nothing\" mentality when it comes to making real change when in fact, this is often not feasible at all. When it comes to being a vegan, we went all in on that right off the hop, but I find most people like to break into it slowly. Maybe cut out meat gradually, then dairy, then eggs. Small changes lead to big things when done on a large scale. I saw a statement somewhere once that really resonated with me. It was something to the effect of \"We don\\'t need a few people making major changes to get things on track, we need the majority of people making a few changes\".\\n\\nEnd rant. Thank you for reading. Keep up the great work all you lovely people and stay safe! Together we will make a real difference.',\n",

       "  'title': 'The essay that convinced me to become a vegan',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'The very fact that one is alive means consuming nutrients ... and staying alive means that something, somewhere, must die in order to supply these nutrients. This is a fact of life ... and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it. One can argue about a belief, an opinion, a theory, an ideal and so on ... but a fact: never. One can deny a fact – pretend that it is not there – but once seen, a fact brings freedom from choice and decision. Most people think and feel that choice implies freedom – having the freedom to choose – but this is not the case. Freedom lies in seeing the obvious, and in seeing the obvious there is no choice, no deliberation, no agonising over the ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ judgment. In the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to. There are people who will not eat red meat at all ... only white meat and fish. Then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm-blooded animals at all ... only fish and reptiles. Then there are people (**vegetarians**) who will not eat any meat at all, but will consume eggs and dairy products. Then there are people (**vegans**) who will eat only vegetables, grain and seed. Then there are people (**fruitarians**) who will only eat fruit. Then – as we go into myth and fantasy – there are those who live on water and air ... and finally those who live on air only!\\n\\nSome vegetarians maintain that as a carrot (for example) does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables. Yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life-support system – the ground is its home – and is this not distressing on some level of a living, growing organism? It all depends upon the level, or degree, of ‘aliveness’ that one ascribes to things. Vegans, for instance, will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born. Fruitarians go one step further and say that, as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life, vegetables are to be eschewed entirely. Then, as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life-forms from growing, they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant-form (I have been a fruitarian so I know full well what I am speaking of).\\n\\nThe obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration. What will one do – as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything – about those pesky things like mosquitoes, sand-flies, cockroaches, rats, mice and other ‘vermin’ that invade my house? Put up screens? What about outside? Will I slap them dead ... or just shoo them away? What will one do if attacked by a snake, a crocodile, a shark, a lion and so on? Do as the Revered Scriptures say and turn the other cheek? Will I humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself – or even killed – simply because of a religious injunction, a moral scruple, a noble ideal, a virtuous belief, a passionate opinion, a deeply held ethical theory? In other words, have animals and insects been given the right, by some inscrutable god, to do with me whatsoever they wish? Is my survival dependent upon the non-existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that I am not going to cause distress to?\\n\\nWhat then about germs, bacteria, bacillus, microbes, pathogens, phages, viruses and so on? Are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free? If one takes medication for disease, one is – possibly painfully – killing off the microscopic creatures that one’s body is the host too. Some religions – the Jain religion in India, for example – has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature. It can really get out of hand. For instance, small-pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives ... is this somehow ‘Wrong’? What is ‘Right’ in regards to what I do in order to stay alive? If I do none of these things then I will be causing pain and suffering to myself ... and I am a sentient being too. It is an impossible scenario, when pursued to its ultimate conclusion.\\n\\nAnd then there is the matter of one’s fellow human beings. Some of them – in fact at times a lot of them – are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in, with the avowed intent of killing, torturing, raping, pillaging and subjugating oneself and one’s fellow citizens. If one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian ... one must be a pacifist as well. This amounts to hanging out a sign – if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief – which says, in effect: ‘Please feel free to invade us, we will not fight back, for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever’ (the Tibetan situation is a particular case in point). Thus anarchy would rule the world ... all because of a belief system handed down by the Saints and the Sages, the Messiahs and the Avatars, the Redeemers and the Saviours, the Prophets and the Priests, century after century.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"My doctor told me to leave out milk products from my meals. So basically to go vegan. 🌱\\n\\nI'm female, 21, and a Vegetarian for a couple of years already, and actually a huge cheese fan. Yikes.\\n\\nHow I ended up in my situation:\\nAfter I turned Vegetarian, I regularly got a rash or something at the finger knuckles of my right hand  - It swells, turns red, tickles and when you touch it, it hurts. This would occur every few months from then, staying for two weeks and then disappear. I hoped it would go away at some point. (I can't tell if turning Vegetarian was the reason it appeared,  I just know it's been happening for couple of years now)\\n\\nThen a few months ago I started to get a stomach ache consistently, nearly every day. It's not strong or anything, but just always there.\\nIt also didn't get better when I switched to oat milk (which is so much better than normal milk, whowie!). 🥳\\n\\nNow I've went to let someone check my hand, and she was asking me if it occurs when I'm on my period, which isn't the case. (It could be because of hormones).\\n So next she asked me how my stomach is feeling and I admitted that it troubles me a lot (Funnily I had to think for a moment cause the tummy ache was so normal for me 😅). \\nShe said, my intestine, so my stomach isn't alright, it afflicts my skin. She recommended me to leave out any milk products for at least four weeks and watch it. 👍🏻\\n\\nSoooo I'm excited to go vegan!\\nProblem: I'm still living with my parents who aren't tooooo happy about me being Vegetarian already.... but they get vegetarian options for me at least. 🙈\\nBut I can't stay dependant on them forever! Especially if I happen to become Vegan. I cant expect them to cook for me anymore. I need to... grow up 😱\\n\\nBut.... I'm just a terrible cook, and to be completely I've never been interested in cooking. It seems like such a bothersome task.. coming up with an idea, getting ingredients, stand there for 2 hours... 🙄 I'm lazy, I recognised it myself, thank you.\\n \\nSo I'm asking you guys for ANY useful advise that you can give me. Whether it is about motivating myself to cook, or vegan recipes, or venting about me being lazy, anything!\\nAlso, do you agree with her theory that the skin rash is directly connected to my stomach condition? \\nI appreciate any message I get 🙏\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S.: Idk if this counts as over-asked question. If so, I am sorry and you may delete this post.\",\n",

She keeps talking about how much “real chicken” has made her feel so much better and healthy and she ALWAYS brings it up with our other friends who eat meat, how she added chicken to her salad and she now feels “nourished” with the “local, free range” chicken she has.

She also gets chicken and burgers while we’re out to eat and knows for a fact that that meat isn’t “sustainable” but says she mostly eats “local, free range chicken” or whatever the fuck marketing they have on it nowadays.\\n\\nMy eating disorder has gotten bad and I’m under a dieticians supervision and have stayed strong in being vegan but it feels like my roommate is constantly rubbing it in my face how much she loves meat now and how much better she feels while eating meat.

I’ve been vegan again for maybe three months, and although I don’t feel like I’m at risk of stopping again I feel like it’s important to see the truth of the matter, to drill in my resolve. And I guess partly self flagellation for my selfishness. \\n \\nI suppose this seems like an unnecessary rant, we’ve probably all felt this way, but I cannot understand how this is happening. How can we do this? I care about the environmental aspect of all of this as well, but even if none of that was a factor, this pain and torture is abominable. If anyone has any belief that we should do good in the world and not cause harm, then you cannot support this industry. The disrespect we’re showing these creatures is like something out of Saw. It should not exist. \\n\\nI’m continually gagging and I’m only ten minutes in. I know all we can do is stop eating it ourselves, and using products, but that doesn’t feel like enough. I’ve always suffered from severe depression, but knowing what is happening in this very moment, and has happened for years, and will seemingly continue is making me sick, and hopeless. \\n\\nMy family and friends don’t want to see, nobody wants to see this.

They can’t even treat the animals with dignity, they actively make their lives even more of a Hell. These beautiful beings only want food and freedom, and would, as individuals show us all the love our pets do. As I write this my cat is climbing in my lap to check on me, because he cares about me. I know if any piglet of calf were rescued they could bond just as much with me. \\n\\nI just wish I could Thanos style snap them out of existence. Maybe that’s cruel too, but it seems better than what they have. Ideally I wish they could live free lives, but what would that mean to a genetically altered beast that no longer has any part in the natural ecosystems. We alter the world with no regard for what could happen. And we deserve whatever we get because of it.

I’m feeling defeated af. I just want to share all the stuff I’ve learned over my, albeit recent, journey with others because I’m excited about it. I’ve read so many science-based books and studies, as well as watched a lot of documentaries about the harms of eating animals and animal byproducts. \\n\\nUnfortunately, people are so biased to eating meat and just blatantly misinformed about the evidence behind the harm of it all. I find myself trying to be as objective and science-based as possible, but I wind up getting into debates I didn’t want to get in. I don’t want to be *that person* who comes across as the condescending vegan forcing their beliefs down someone else’s throats... because apparently that’s just automatically how you’re perceived as soon as someone learns you don’t eat meat and care about the planet. Insert eye roll here. I just want to be an advocate without being too much. \\n\\nI just want to help other people. I wish I had known about all the health benefits to eating plant-based much sooner. I wish I had known the full extent about how even just drinking milk and supporting the dairy industry results in cows suffering. I was just blissfully ignorant I guess. But I really wish I had made the switch years ago. \\n\\nAnyways, any advice on how to not feel so sad and defeated about people just not caring about going plant-based?

       "  'selftext': \"I've been a long-term vegetarian, mostly started because I didn't like the idea of complicated, emotional creatures like pigs and cows being factory farmed with little concern for their well-being. \\n\\nThis stance has expanded over the years to include the obvious environmental argument for a reduced land-use impact on the world and reduction of the high greenhouse gas emissions that result from raising the billions of animals we slaughter every year. \\n\\nI haven't however yet went so far as to cut out animal products, such as eggs and dairy, especially as I can buy some of them from a farm near my house that has a  lovely sense of animal welfare. But after speaking with my roommates more about reducing our individual impacts, I decided to look closely at what the emissions are of the foods that I commonly eat, and, wow:\\n\\nIt turns out cheese, chocolate, and coffee account for the bulk of what's left of my food-related greenhouse emissions. The rough ball park is that my consumption of just those three products leads to about 500kg of CO2 equivalents being emitted per year. Equal to roughly what I emit from power consumption or traveling by bus/subway/rail. The rest of my food consumption combined probably only equals 200-300kg of CO2, with a lot of that being from olive oil. \\n\\n(Using the data found here:)\\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local\\n\\nIt's a tough sell for me, as I like practically every cheese and would put it on every meal in some way. Chocolate isn't a huge deal for me, and I've replaced coffee with some other coffee-like products made from wheat that don't have caffeine but do the trick for me. \\n\\nProbably I will take an approach to reduce my consumption, allowing the odd cheesy treat instead of having it be a very regular part of my purchases/diet. \\n\\nAnyway I kinda just wanted to think this through and type it out, happy to hear some (friendly) criticism, other non-partisan sources of info, discussion that isn't just expressing morals to each other, etc.\",\n",

Also if something is not useful to human society we do not let it survive. He provides the example of dogs being tied up or caged. If dogs are let loose, things could be worse for civilization, he argues. \\nI see a point in what Sadguru says and am bit confused on the macro factors of going vegan.

Since then It's like my mind has opened and I can sympathize with animal on a much more intense and emotional level. Before, it was like my mind protected itself by turning it of. (got my dog a year ago).\\n\\nAbout the dream: I started my studies wanting to research the brain and mental illness. I wanted to find what happens in the brain during therapy vs. medication. But as I'm in my fourth year, I'm realizing this won't be possible without animal experiments, and I don't think I can do it. I have found that I have an interest in bacteria (the good and the bad kind!) and I have gotten an internship this summer with a research group studying the plauge bacteria, and I danced with joy! Yet this morning I'm drinking my tea, eating my hemp seed toast, and feeling a loss for what could have been. I have  my own experience with mental illness and my best friend of 15 years have battled it her while life, and I was really wanting to make a difference in the field. I can't help but feeling a little weak, but the thought of spending my career experimenting on mice makes me want to vomit, flies were bad enough.\\n\\nI don't know if anyone will read this, but it felt somewhat therapeutic to type it out. I hope you are all being safe and taking care of your physical and mental well being in these crazy times.\",\n",

Never has anyone interacted with a vegan for more than 5 minutes without having to talk about something related to health, animal rights, or that new vegan place that ‘everyone needs to try’. They steer the conversation towards it. Any conversation. \\n\\nPerson: “Hey I like those shoes”\\nVegan:  “oh thank you, they’re vegan leather because the factory farming industry is destroying the planet and I just can’t contribute to that.” \\n\\nNo one enjoys mealtime with vegans. They are not fun to cook for because they ask too many questions about the food you had to go online to find a vegan recipe for; and they also manage to suck to go out to eat with as well. They either have to go to specific restaurants or they have to spend 10 minutes modifying something on the menu. The prospect of eating with them is a chore and it inconveniences everyone involved. \\n\\nVegans use weird products and further vegan they go, the weirder the products they use. Some things used by vegans are okay such as essential oil diffusers, others aren’t. I’ve seen hard core vegans use natural deodorants, smelled them too, may as well have rubbed apricot and ass under their armpits. The worst I’ve seen was a coworker of mine with yellow teeth using fluoride free natural toothpaste.\\n\\nVegans act like their minute dietary change is ‘who they are as a person now’ and base their whole persona off of it; but that trait can primarily be attributed to one of the main causes of veganism, which is the lack of enough personality traits to make them interesting as normal people. This needs to stop. I like the idea of being vegan, I like vegan food, I see nothing wrong with veganism except for the people. It’s not a loud minority, it’s the lot. \\n\\nJust food for thought and don’t worry because it’s dairy free, gluten free, cruelty free, meat free, duty free, sulfate free, sugar free, free of gmos and pesticides, free of added chemicals and harsh ingredients, free of charge. Just all natural, organic food for thought. Anyway, goodnight.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Genuinely curious, I’ve been vegan for years (I feel very strongly about it) and I consider myself a centrist. I’m not saying veganism is politically related, but I’ve just noticed that most vegans are liberal. I’ve also seen lots of conservatives completely trash on vegans.\\n\\nI believe that veganism doesn’t have a political affiliation just as like how being against slavery doesn’t have a political affiliation. I’m really big on free thought, valuing facts over emotion (which conservatives constantly promote), and I view this as being 100% in line with being vegan. Ignoring animal slaughter and torture is the OPPOSITE of “facts over feelings.” If you feel so strongly about your love of meat and are willing to ignore all the facts that meat/meat products do to the world and to animals - then that is the definition of being ~too sensitive~\\n\\nOn the other hand I do think that liberalism ideology *today* is not very rooted in facts at all. The social change that liberals tend to promote going on now (feminism, racial movements, etc), in my opinion, has taken a dark turn don’t make a whole lot of sense when you look at the facts. I obviously support equality for all races, genders, sexual orientations, everything! But the ideological underpinning of what the movements  have become today is something I don’t necessarily agree with. And I just think they are so dissimilar from being vegan but are branded the same way!\\n\\nAnd if you don’t care, then just say you don’t care but don’t brand vegans as being “touchy feely” when its tangible, harmful effects are supported by so much evidence.\\n\\nI suppose that most of the correlation of how vegans are usually left-leaning is because liberals are known for being big on social change and conservatives are more adamant on traditional values. \\n\\nIt’s just interesting to me, what do you guys think?',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Non-vegans often talk about veganism like it's this big sacrifice, and I know that's how it seems when you're looking at it through the lens of carnism, but after being vegan for three years, I can honestly say that I love being vegan. \\n\\nI love the food. I'm moving to Seattle soon, and the few times I've visited there, I was blown away by the all-vegan restaurants. In 21 years living on Earth, I'm not exaggerating when I say the best food I've ever eaten in my life was from an all-vegan restaurant in Seattle (if you live in Seattle, you might know the place I'm talking about; it's in Greenlake 😉). But it's not just restaurants. Vanilla Oat Yeah is, like, my favorite drink. It's so delicious and I'm not surprised big dairy is scared of veganism because cow's milk was never as good as oat milk. \\n\\nI love the people. Vegans are some of the coolest people I know. Vegans are brave. You have to be brave to stand up to a cultural institution that's as huge and oppressive as carnism, to stand up to friends and family who constantly ridicule and question us. Vegans are kind. It shouldn't take a lot of empathy to realize that animals' lives are more important than humans' taste buds, but it does, and you can see it in the way vegans talk to and support each other and interact with animals and the world around them. \\n\\nFinally, I love the animals. When you think about it, not harming animals is such a simple and obvious thing, which is why we say it's the moral baseline. It *is* the  moral baseline. But I still love it. I love knowing that when I say I care about animals, it's not hollow and ironic. I love petting my cat and knowing that farmed animals have just as much individuality and personality as she does, and that I'm no longer supporting their torture and murder. So to all non-vegans, just remember: it takes nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal. And to all vegans: I love you homie\",\n",

He has decided a couple of weeks ago to go vegan, I am still vegetarian which I know a lot of vegans look down on so I’m sorry for that 😕 I have been supportive as I can buying him a tasty looking vegan things that I can find! Can anybody recommend their favourite vegan cheese? It doesn’t necessarily have to be from the UK as a lot of sites import it! Also looking for suggestions on the best vegan chocolate that taste the most like milk chocolate. I have just found a local delivery service of a milkman and they do their own oat milk and it is absolutely delicious, so I have just eliminated dairy milk from my life forever as I can’t believe how much nicer that out milk is… Just need to find a good cheese and maybe we can be onto a winner. \\n\\nOn a side note one of the things that worries me the most about becoming vegan is how restrictive and limiting it is. Does anybody here still for example eat cereal bars and crisps etc with milk powder in, And just not consume ‘raw’ dairy such as drinking milk or using butter?\\n\\nThanks I’m advance for any help!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This post is also for people considering veganism, but are scared to \"take the leap\". \\n\\nI became vegan just 2 months ago, but I think this might help someone. \\n\\nI used to be a massive meat eater, just 2 months ago. Seriuously I couldn\\'t rember going more than 1 day without some type of meat before going vegan (im serious). I used to proud myself in saying \"if it doesn\\'t contain meat, its not a real meal.\" Obviusly that was a joke, but there was truth to it for sure. \\n\\nThe first week going vegan I felt absolutely miserable. I thought I would never enjoy food again. ALL of my favourite recepies not only included meat and dairy, but basically revolved around them. I was actually super depressed. I even made a post here lol. I remeber trying a beyond burger, and literally thinking \"yep, this doesn\\'t taste anything like meat, I guess I am cursed to never enjoy food in my life.\" Also cooking vegan bolognese fot the first time, and remeber trying it out and just throwing the whole pot away because it was gross.\\n\\nThen for some reason, I swear to Zeus, after trying my second beyond burger (since the only way to get it was to buy the 10-pack) I was like \"what the hell, this isn\\'t bad at all?\". Third time trying it, I was hooked. Its really bizzare, that it changed so quickly, but I remeber the first time the smell while it was raw (cat food, lets be honest) and grilling was foul to me. I still is, but when grilled, its godlike. Like serously, I make sure not to eat more than 1 or 2 every 2 weeks, since it isn\\'t the healthiest food, but I would crush them and inject them in my bloodstream if I could now. Well made beyond burger with sexy lettuce, juciy tomatos, fried onions, spicy jalapeños, BBQ and chipotle sauce and baked potatos, oh lordy. Im a simple man, and thats a food orgasm to me. \\n\\nAlso I tried to make a few adjustements to my vegan bolognese and it turned out extrenely delicious, literally the polar opposite of my first try.\\n\\nWhat I wanted to say with this is don\\'t get discouraged at the beggineng. Some things are different when it comes to recepies and it will take you some time to adjust. But I have to say, for me it changed super quickly. Way quicker than I would have thought. I haven\\'t craved meat at all and I have never been a big cheese person anyway (I did buy vegan cheese for my bolognese and it was dope too!!). \\n\\nSo if anyone is currently starting out, just because you currently feel like shit, doesn\\'t not mean its your new \"normal\". Its NOT! Just experiment and check out youtube channels or articles. Trust me you are gonna find delicious food, and learn to make it. And this comes from a former meatholic.',\n",

I did blood tests a few months ago and I didn\\'t have any nutritional deficiency   except vitamin D for wich i took a supplement since.I also don\\'t have any physical health problems  and my weight is normal (I lost some unecessary weight since I went vegeterian).Also I don\\'t smoke and I haven\\'t drunk alcohol since many months \\n\\nI was feeling very healthy until 1-2 weeks ago.I experience a sudden and intense depression,sleepiness eventhough I sleep for 6-8 hours [normaly.My](https://normaly.My) sperm count has been reduced (slightly,not a big difference) ,and for the last days I have an almost total lack of \"morning wood\" which is a red [flag.It](https://flag.It)\\'s also very hard for me to have a sexual arousal but even if this could be mental problem,the lack of physical arousal in the morning is related to physical problems. I have mental health issues for many years,mainly severe anxiety and OCD and moderate  depression which they gotten worst the last year due to to the pandemic and unemployment but I don\\'t remember affecting me this way that much.I don\\'t take any medication,except of benzodiazepines ocassionaly\\n\\nI base my nutritional needs mostly on legumes,but I also eat fruits and vegetables,mushrooms sometimes,nuts,tahini,fortified cereal and plant based milk and cheese and eggs as I said. I eat soy products but on moderation because I\\'m confused about if they cause estrogenic activity or not. \\n\\nMy concern is that maybe cutting meat and not getting enough protein could have reduced my testosterone levels?\\n\\nAny advice about what to do and eat would be helpful.I will start drinking coffee again which I  didn\\'t drunk for a few months and pomegranate juice,ginger because I read that they help boosting testosterone',\n",

I'm also seeing this in people getting upset about environmental science about animal agriculture (like people in the hard science trying their best to stop the largest harms to both humans and non-human animals which are in fact factory farms and smaller farms where animals are specifically raised for meat) splitting hairs over backyard eggs. This overall lack of perspective within the vegan community doesn't help any real world animals and turns non-vegans away from veganism. \\n\\nI don't see plant-based doctors or major animal rights organizations promoting this mentality (to the contrary Direct Action Everywhere invites sincere non-vegans to their meetings and activism, only requiring community leaders to be vegan) and I think it's really toxic to act like vegans are all precious babies who can't be movers and shakers in the real world.

I have been vegan for 3 or so years now and I never thought I\\'d have a problem with my partner eating meat but I\\'m finding myself feeling conflicted about this situation. \\n\\nLet me tell you about my partner. He is a young adult from East Malaysia and we have known one another for 3 years in a long distance relationship. One time early on in the relationship he sent me a very long list of reasons why veganism is not good, most of them were health reasons. He now has come to respect my diet and even supports my vegan page. He even sends me recipes now. I\\'ve never once said anything about his diet and simply stated that I\\'m fine with him just as long as he doesn\\'t expect me to cook for him.\\n\\nThe problem I have with him is the insane variety of meats he eats. He consumes everything from pangolin, frogs, insects, jellyfish, crocodile, water monitors, frogs, pig insides... The list is endless, and of course he eats the standard pork, beef chicken and fish. He also slaughters animals when it comes to traditional native festivities. This as you might imagine is very hard for a vegan to tolerate, and I feel I am coming to a point where I might burst if he tries to describe to me what a squirrel tastes like again. \\n\\nI know it\\'s not his fault I feel this way because I\\'ve never confronted him. And when I\\'ve shown discomfort he gently says he\\'ll never let me see the slaughters and that I must understand it is just \"traditional\". And that this is how Malaysia is. It\\'s the norm. I don\\'t believe that it\\'s difficult to go against the norm nor find vegan or vegetarian dishes there, having gone myself.\\n\\nI want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how I can change his ways of eating but I don\\'t know how to begin. When I ask my parents they just say I must respect that or leave him. I love him incredibly and want to show him how amazing veganism or even just reducing meat intake can be. Should I tell him to not talk about meat in front of me? Should I make him watch a documentary with me online? Advice needed please! I need to do something ASAP because I find myself disliking him so much at times, while trying to tolerate his diet.',\n",

People started to notice and I was basically forced to eat more until I gained the weight back. Later that year I started throwing up my food to avoid gaining weight. I would regularly pass out. \\n\\nWhen I was 14 I came across a vegan YouTuber and my first reaction was “how fucking stupid” but then after listening and looking at more vegan youtubers and eventually watching ‘earthlings’ I knew I could no longer support the meat or dairy industry. \\n\\nI went whole-food vegan. And after a few months I noticed I was at my desired weight (about 135lbs and 19.5 BMI) it took no effort whatsoever either. Months go by and I wouldn’t lose or gain any weight despite not looking at my calorie consumption and eating plenty of food. I also felt happier and had more energy. \\n\\nFast forward to today I’m 22 years old and have had no issues with my eating disorder. I’m still at around 135lbs average and I couldn’t be happier. \\n\\nI know this probably won’t be the case for everyone but it was a really nice bonus to not supporting animal suffering.',\n",

Fox hunting is when a group of people get together with their trained hounds, find an area with foxes(sometimes trapping them in a caged in field), set their dogs on them, and watch as their hounds chase them down and rip them to shreds a while the fox is still alive. Why do people do this, you might ask? It’s not to keep their population down. It’s not for their fur. It’s not even to “protect” livestock. It’s for entertainment. Sick, morbid, disgusting, human entertainment. It doesn’t matter who you are. Most people can(should) look at this after being educated on it and go “wow. That is evil.” Please join me in helping the fight to get this more securely banned. It’s not just foxes either.

       "  'selftext': 'Unfortunately, I have been in a binge cycle since March 2020. Literally the only relief I had from it was when I was vegan. \\n\\nA few months ago I was watching a lot of vegan media on YouTube and I went vegan again (previously was vegan a few years ago) and it really helped me to stop binging!! It was such a great thing and I felt so good in so many ways. \\n\\nThen, after a while, I had one big binge and I ate animal products in it. It\\'s been about 2 weeks of me not eating vegan again since then and it 100% just stems from me being unconscious to my truer wants and being out of control to the binging. \\n\\nMy stomach has been in constant pain from the meat and dairy products honestly. I think it\\'s incredible how once you stop something you realize what a strange \"normal\" you were accustomed too. \\n\\nI also quit coffee 2 months ago and I used to think I just naturally went to sleep at 11 pm-1 am but now I get proper tired between 9-10 pm. \\nI feel like the same happened with animal products; I\\'m now really aware of how crazily they wreck up my digestion! \\n\\nAnyway, I need to get back on track so I\\'m buckling down today and going back to being vegan. I know it\\'s an important thing to me for many reasons; the animals, health, human exploitation, and the environment. \\n\\nJust wanted to share, thanks. :) \\nAlso please don\\'t judge me for binging. :( I\\'m embarrassed about it honestly but maybe someone else can relate?',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I was inspired by watching Rotten on Netflix, and the subsequent research I did after that. \\n\\nThe avocado industry has skyrocketed in the last 10 years, being marketed as a super food, trendy and a status symbol. \\n\\nWith this boom, comes issues. Most of the US's avocados come from Mexico, where the industry has been contributing to habitat loss, climate change and loss of eco systems, as well as funding drug cartels. Who then, in turn, harass, kidnap and kill locals. \\n\\nAvocados are water hungry fruits, taking about 1000 litres of water to produce 1kg. In Chile, one of the main providers to Europe, local avocado farmers are being run out of business because they can't afford the water needed for their crops. Rivers have dried up, wells are drying up and the elite control the precious resource. I'm sure you can extrapolate what it means for the environment and human rights when the water drys up and is seen as a commodity, but those who have spoken up about it have received death threats. \\n\\nSo what can you do? \\n\\nFor Europe, buying the fruit from Spain ensures its traveled less, and ethically produced. \\nFor the US, its not that simple. Even home grown crop has its issues, because they need so much water, it contributes to the desertification of already arid states. \\n\\nObviously, these options aren't perfect. The best you could do is decrease the amount you eat avocado, or stop altogether.  \\n\\nIf you want to find out more - \\n\\nhttps://www.peacefuldumpling.com/avocado-deforestation-cartels-droughts-wildlife-loss\\n\\nhttps://sustainablefoodtrust.org/articles/why-our-love-for-avocados-is-not-sustainable/\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2018/dec/10/should-you-stop-eating-blood-avocados\",\n",

I've been a vegetarian since I was 8 and I'm just now turning 21 and the main issue as to why I haven't become vegan is I cannot find a good cheese and milk alternative. I've heard good things about violife brand cheese so I am going to check that out (feel free to name other brands!), but milk is tough. I use macadamia sometimes for cereal, and the oat cafe style for lattes but all the other milk give my foods and other drink a weird funky taste.  I don't like cashew, and almond milk is bad for the environment (and just tastes kinda bland), and I wasn't a big fan of regular oat milk so   I am not sure what to use really. I am not completely opposed to buying a bunch of different milk but it would be nice to find a milk alternative that works with eveyrthing! Lastly, if anyone can provide any insight on if blue agave is a good alternative to honey that would be great. alright! sorry for the long post! thank you, everyone.\",\n",

Which is worse for your arteries.\\n\\nIt's crazy to think 200 calories of some tofu can have around 100% of your RDI in supplemental form.  Not natural calcium forms.

       "  'selftext': 'If this isn\\'t allowed in r/vegan I\\'m sorry. Take the post down.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nHello to all you wonderful green people of [r/vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan)\\n\\nFirst of all I want to say three crucial things:\\n\\n\\\\#1 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering. This is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non-vegan. \\n\\n\\\\#2 I hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work. Let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that I will ever hear about what I do is my own voice. This post is because I\\'d like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me. This project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth, and I\\'d like to try at least to inspire someone to join me. I\\'m doing this because this is what I would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world.\\n\\n\\\\#3 I hope to clarify that I don\\'t sell anything, nor that I am going to. This post is not about trying to get people to WATCH my content. It\\'s about asking WHAT the vegan community would like to see and hear more of. \\n\\nFor the animals, together we stand strong!\\n\\n\\\\---Abstract/TLDR---\\n\\nWhat kind of content would you, yourself, have wanted to see produced on YouTube? \\n\\nIs there anything I can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on YouTube? \\n\\nAre there any specific topics, questions, or things I can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals? \\n\\nIs there any suffering (vystopia) which people struggle with, and I can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on YouTube or otherwise? \\n\\nAny other questions, information, contact info about me, or anything else, please leave a comment. It would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you.\\n\\n\\\\---lengthy post with lots of details about who I am, where I\\'m from, what drives me and why I do what I do follows--- \\n\\nSo basically what drives, and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy, and gratitude I get from just the simple fact of being vegan, from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that I live life, I\\'m sparing animals from being killed. That is what I fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community. I really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals. I want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious. \\n\\nThis is what the brand I have created since November 2020 has turned into today. \\n\\nMetta Sutta Vegan Activism:\\n\\nThe name \"Metta Sutta\" is inspired by a Buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill, and it\\'s something I really found inspiring because it\\'s what we as vegans do towards animals.\\n\\nThis is what I\\'ve been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks (I\\'ve only recently started being active)\\n\\n\\\\*I\\'ve been active in Facebook comments on agricultural/vegan groups for the last month \\n\\n\\\\*Me and my girlfriend started a podcast (Norwegian podcast) this easter - it\\'s gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community!\\n\\n\\\\*I have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high-quality videos: mirrorless camera, professional recording software, microphones, website, ads, etc...\\n\\n\\\\*Recently, I started producing videos on YouTube. This will be my primary focus from now on. I\\'m working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself, which is a major reason as to why I\\'m asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism.\\n\\n\\\\*Recently started a Metta Sutta Instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos, quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals.\\n\\n\\\\*Recently became active in reddit (this account is 3 days old :) )\\n\\nI know me posting this may be something that I regret doing \"too soon.\" Still, I would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far, and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and, hopefully, find someone that would like to connect more with me. \\n\\nFrom the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind, we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging, and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat-eaters in more effective ways? That\\'s my highest hope, and I wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this. I\\'ve read the book \"A Plea for the Animals\" by a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard and recently listened to \"The Joyful Vegan\" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. I find these books highly inspiring, and I want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format. And what I\\'m hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here, I would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to offer to create a place, a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity, and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it!\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nA little bit more about me: I\\'m 22 years old, I\\'ve been vegan for 1,5 years now, and l live in Norway. When I first went vegan, I was met with so much resistance from family, friends, and the society around me, and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day, has been a really hard, but rich learning experience. What I really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing, as well as (hopefully) helping meat-eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice.\\n\\nHow our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people\\'s minds, at their stage of development, through the heart, in a way that\\'s relatable, in my opinion. \\n\\nIf anyone is interested in checking me out, I do have a website: [www.mettasutta.net](https://www.mettasutta.net/) \\\\- although I\\'d like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet, it\\'s under construction. Alternatively check out my youtube channel. I recently deleted all my videos from other channels, and reuploaded the best I\\'ve made thus far on my main channel \"Metta Sutta\". Some are English, some are Norwegian.  \\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ)  \\nIf there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far, feedback is highly appreciated.   \\n\\n\\nI will be actively responding to whatever does (or doesn\\'t) come out of this post. I\\'m a little bit giddy, and nervous, but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping that I can use the responses I get from everyone in the r/vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how I need to align myself going forward, to better help the animals that are suffering every day! \\n\\nIf there are any spelling errors, or there is some clarification that\\'s needed, please let me know!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This question was asked on Quora and I responded to it: here is what I wrote\\n\\n TLDR for below: I basically use some facts from cowspiracy plus other bits of information I\\'ve picked up. I explain regardless of legitimacy of activism, it is the message we need to get behind.\\n\\nThing is, the post isn\\'t getting any views and I was wondering if that site is actively supressing it. I was wondering if people can go to the site to at least just view the post, which might help it appear in peoples feeds. Here is the link:\\n\\n[https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts) \\n\\n\"For someone like me, this seems like a disingenuous question. Why does it matter if its false or legitimate encouragement? The message is definitely something to get behind, considering the large devastation caused by animal agriculture. The animals themselves suffer so much.\\n\\nDon’t give me crap about plants are living beings too; that’s a double whammy considering, for example, that the USA has a population of 320 million and grows enough grain for 800 million people. Most of it goes to feed livestock. All that mindless consumption and cruelty just for our taste buds. The first sentence of your ‘plant lives matter’ manifesto should be “stop the animal agriculture industry”.\\n\\nIncidentally, the implications for water consumption in the US are stark. The animal agriculture industry uses around 50 trillion gallons of water annually. To put this in some kind of perspective, 5% of water is consumed by homes compared to around 55% for animal agriculture. In fact, on a global scale, animal agriculture uses up to a third of the worlds fresh water. That’s woeful when literally thousands of kids die of waterborne illnesses everyday. Also, livestock covers 45% of the worlds land mass, having the biggest impact on species extinction and habitat destruction.\\n\\nNot to mention animal agriculture being responsible for 18% of greenhouse gases, more than all of our planes, train and automobiles combined. Some estimates put this at 51%, when you combine all greenhouse gases of animal agriculture and its by-products. Additionally, compared to human waste, there is 130 times more animal waste produced in the USA.\\n\\nWe’re deforesting the amazon, the literal lungs of our planet, to make way for soy production and livestock. Before you even think about blaming vegans for eating butt-loads of tofu, most of that soy is used as feed for the livestock. Soy for human consumption from this area only accounts for about 6% directly. So much for soy boys, when you consider who is eating the most soy indirectly.\\n\\nThen the health implications of meat and dairy. Heart disease, cancer, strokes, obesity etc. The Wests health care bills, especially the USAs, are spiralling out of control. And its not all to do with an aging population. Just take a look at blue zones where they consume much less meat per capita, they have more health in their long years.\\n\\nTake this anecdote as you will but I know how real this is. One of my older cousins had a bypass operation two years ago at the age of 41. He took BP pills, had sky high cholesterol and ate meat all day everyday, 21 meals a week. His favourite was a nice fatty lamb curry with a few pints of lager down the pub. He wasn’t even that overweight.\\n\\nThen the climate change impact of all this… if you don’t know about this, then where have you been? You can’t refute the claims of literally thousands of expert scientists on this matter (even if a literal handful of them claim climate change is bogus.)\\n\\nOkay, I can concede that maybe Netflix has a target demographic which appeals to millenials and other youngsters. After all, millennials are probably the main drivers behind the veganism ‘epidemic’. But here’s the thing, millenial or boomer, Netflix or regular programming, legit humanity or narcissistic activism… people aren’t asking the right questions and we’re running out of time. A barren wasteland cannot support a single crop, let alone billions of humans and their monstrously expensive tastes.\\n\\nHang on, this is not only a disingenuous question, its quite frankly a callous question. I feel a little sorry for the person who asked it. I can at least be a voice for the massive, mindless cruelty inflicted by human society on the animals, the planet and most idiotically… **OURSELVES.\"**\\n\\n[COWSPIRACY: The Sustainability Secret](https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Okay, so I’ve read and heard a lot of people discussing eggs. I had a friend who bashed me for having chickens and eating their eggs, saying it’s cruel.\\n\\nNow I am not vegan, but I wouldn’t really have an issue becoming vegan, as in I don’t have some driven need to eat meat/animal products and more often than not I don’t eat any animal products just by chance.\\n\\nAnyway, I have a Vegan friend, but I don’t know his motivations or anything about being a vegan. He was a lil mad at me for having chickens and eating their eggs.\\n\\nThe only reason I have chickens is because my parents rescued them. (We also have a turkey who was rejected from her flock, don’t plan on eating her and she has been accepted by our chickens)\\n\\nNow I stopped buying eggs because I know how horrible egg chickens are treated and instead of buying cruelty free, I just treat my chickens humanly. They have a pretty big coop with room for everyone(Even the turkey) and a pretty big run that’s safe from the animals living around my house.\\n\\nI make sure to feed them with good feed and any vegetables scraps I have, I sit with them basically everyday so they aren’t startles by me entering their coop, I did name them as chicks, but as they grew up they got less and less distinct. I make sure they’re comfortable and happy.\\n\\nI do take the eggs they produce and eat them and give them out to family so they also don’t have to buy eggs from mistreated chickens.\\n\\nNow, a lot of vegans hate this notion because it’s still an animal product, but isn’t being a vegan more about the cruelty and less about the actual by product? \\n\\nLike I am aware that chickens eat the shells of their eggs(I’ve read mixed things on the actually inside bits), so I usually crush up the eggs shells and mix it into their feed, but I also have a bag of crushed sea shells just incase\\n\\nBasically my friend said I was still harming them by just owning them, but I really do treat them as good as my dogs and if I didn’t take care of em they would have either went to someone else who might not have.\\n\\nBasically I’m wondering if veganism doesn’t include eggs because of cruelty or simply because they’re an animal product. Cuz my friend seemed pretty ticked, but I’m treating them well.\\n\\nSorry for any spelling or grammar errors.',\n",

I manage a restaurant (not vegan) but have interest in starting a vegan ‘something’ for my peace of mind of what I’m selling to people each day. Problem is, quite frankly I don’t know where to start. It’s quite overwhelming and none of us have money saved which I’m thinking will stop us right from the start. 😬 It’s kind of made me think about a food truck, seems like it would be less expensive than renting out a bigger space and investing in more equipment. Anyways, experiences are welcome if you’ve been in this situation and started your own vegan business! Id love to hear how you got started and how you marketed, etc. I truly believe that more people would be vegan if they had more options (I only have 1 completely vegan restaurant anywhere close to me) and realized how delicious it could be and that they’re not ‘missing out’.

Basically as the title says- sometimes eg at work on a zoom call, someone will say they cooked a roast over the weekend and go into detail re the products, or even just say they’re getting something chicken-y or the like for lunch (sorry being vague because I think none of us really want those details.) Is there a way to tell ripple while being quite non confrontational that you’d like to be spared these details? Since it’s often at work I’d like to not rock the boat or get talked about for being “precious” or the like. But I don’t really want to have to put up with it either. Furthermore when you’re around good friends is it possible to ask that we have a vegan meal at a restaurant even if we’re ordering two different things? I just don’t want to see it there and tbh it makes me feel so more distant from a person when they’re ordering inhumane food. Thanks in advance awesome people 🌱',\n",

I am also an avid runner, and my vegan diet plus my exercise routine has helped me lose nearly 130 lbs. \\n\\nBecause I exercise so much, I try to eat at least 100 grams of protein a day. I have recently upped my calories to 1700 and I’m considering even moving it to 1800 as I start maintenance.\\n\\nI haven’t had much trouble getting to 100 grams of protein a day, but I feel like I’ve been able to do it by focusing on a few staples (tofu/soy, peanut butter powder, protein shakes) and not really eating a varied mix of fruit and veg. Most days, a banana is the only fruit I eat. I have managed to sneak in more veggies to my meals, but I could definitely eat more of a rainbow.\\n\\nI guess my question is, with all my activity, am I eating enough protein, too much, or too little? I would like to vary my meals a bit more. I want to start eating oatmeal with peanut butter and banana in the mornings and not worry if the meal has a certain amount of protein. I want to start adding roasted potatoes or veggies to my dinners and again, not stress so much on if I’m hitting that 100 g mark. When I don’t meet it, I often opt to cut out veggies and add something like nutritional yeast in order to get to 100 g while not going over calories. \\n\\nI feel very good when I get 100 grams of protein or more, and it’s been so long since I ate less than that. I’m just wondering if I could be a little more flexible with that number and still maintain my fitness level for running.\\n\\nThanks in advance!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"The neighbors above me have a dog who is CONSTANTLY barking during the day (that's not an exaggeration, it goes on literally all day, and I'm listening to it right now). I manage to tune it out pretty well, so the annoyance of the noise is not really a concern. What I'm much more concerned about is the wellbeing of the fuckin dog, for a few reasons:\\n\\n1. Dogs don't just bark all day for no reason, right? Sure some are more rowdy and hyper than others, but it lives on the third floor of a building, what does it have to bark at that it can see out the windows?\\n2. The dog sounds choked. The barking doesn't sound playful; it sounds more like gasping and yelping, and sometimes it quiets down for a minute and instead I hear low, slight howling, before the barking picks up again.\\n3. The sound always comes from the same part of the apartment. I hear it much more clearly in one room than I do elsewhere in my apartment. \\n4. The people have lived here for at least 5 months, and I have NEVER ONCE seen them walking a dog outside or even taking a dog out to go to the bathroom real quick. My roommate, who hasn't been working for the last couple months and has been here a lot, has also never seen or heard any sign of the dog going outside.\\n\\nI wouldn't have thought much of it until I realized those last two points. Would it seriously be possible that they're keeping the dog in one of the rooms and not taking it outside? If so, how the fuck do they deal with the dog going to the bathroom? I have no sense of smell, but my roommate said she doesn't smell anything suspicious. I just don't wanna take any rash actions. I knocked on the door upstairs and the guy answered but he spoke almost no English, I think he thought I was just telling him to keep his dog down. I don't wanna call animal control because I'm worried they will just euthanize the dog or some shit, seems like most organizations are always so quick to do that. I think my best bet is to ask the property manager if they could just go in there and take a look at things, but that might also result in animal control coming. Are there types of animal control places that I could contact that would know how to better deal with this situation? Or should I just assume the dog is okay and just leave them be? I don't know what to do, so I'm turning to my fellow vegans.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Disclaimer: I am not actually vegan, and don't ever see myself being vegan. I can understand the benefits of vegetarianism and could one day take that route, but currently believe veganism is actually ethically counterproductive. Thats a discussion we can save for another time.  \\n\\nAnyway, I was having a debate with my significant other the other day about hunting. This isn't pertaining to illegal hunting, poaching or any form of hunting that actively kills an already diminishing species. This is more in regards to sport hunting and other legal forms of hunting. My significant other is vegan. \\n\\nSo, anyway, I personally feel as though hunting isn't as bad as it is made out to be. My SO felt quite the opposite. She basically stated that killing any animal under any circumstance is one of the worst things you can do. Although I do agree to some extent, I do believe that there is a lot more to take into consideration than just the death of the animal. In particular, I made the argument that sport hunting and the industry actually does bring about a lot more good than people realize. A lot of hunters pay for permits, and in some cases of big game pay thousands of dollars to kill one animal. This money is often put back into the land used for preservation purposes as well as funding security for those animals which are often poached. The documentary Trophy discusses this particularly well in my opinion. If if were not for this money put back into preservation, I believe that a lot of forgotten land would be taken advantage of by big business for development purposes. Additionally, in the case of invasive species, it can actually be beneficial to hunt those animals as to preserve the indigenous populations. My SO, however, did not feel the same way at all. She said that no matter the circumstance hunting is ethically wrong and should be looked down upon.\\n\\nAt this point, I decided to bring up the famous ethical trolley problem. Instead of giving her the situation using people, I instead used deers. Would it be okay to kill 1 deer if you could save 100 deers from death. She was very turnt off by this question. She first tried to say that she would not make that decision but would rather die before making it at first, until I pressed her. She eventually landed on not killing the 1 deer because she could never be the person that determines the death of an animal. I thought this was a bit of a cop out and explained to her that one would then assume that she is basically letting the other 100 deer die. She argued that it was a ridiculous scenario and not one that can be related to ethics at all. That i should not have brought up that situation when discussing animal activism. Oh well.\\n\\nAnyway, my point was to say that hunting, legally, may result in the death of a few animals but at the same time it could bring money to help preserve many more animals and environments. Ultimately then, if done correctly, hunting wouldn't be so bad and instead could have positive benefits. Especially since it is already so hard to fund land preservation and hire lawyers willing to fight against big businesses for this purpose. Anyway that was a brief rundown of the discussion at hand. I know she values the opinion of this community so I am posing the question to you guys. What are your takes on hunting?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAppreciate the time you've taken to read this post, I know it's a long one. Look forward to some good discussion.\",\n",

Lyme, deficiencies, stress, ptsd, perhaps still b12 issues or iodine, and low coq10/omega-3, histamine intolerance..)\\n\\nWhole body burning intensly, spleen tickling burning too, liver tickling burning too, toxic gut feeling, very many emotional issues, burn out, insomnia, fed up by everyone, heart issues, lung issues, basically every organ, greasy skin, very disgusted by meat.\\n\\nI also am on benzo wirthdrawal so a lot of stuff hete but if anyone had a detox from meat maybe it would be more simple to tell me your symptoms as mine overlap many health issues !!\\n\\nWe get our B12 by fermented foods right ? It doesn't make any sense to me to be supplementing as it is created by b13/orotic acid right ? I know out soils are depleted but my body cannot handle b12 supplements. (maybe bcs of iodine, selenite, molybdate and so b2 deficiency.)\",\n",

I grew up in Blowmaha Nebraska and moved to PHX about 3 years ago,  right about the time I became vegan. It was difficult but not impossible to not eat meat in the middle of beef country, but I\\'d say pretty much impossible to avoid things like butter and eggs in sauces and such. Much easier here in the Land of Produce :D\\nAnyways, I\\'m 6\\'10\" 360 lbs and I\\'ve never really been into fitness or exercise. I hate to use a cliche, but I truly don\\'t have the time for it. I recently went to a gym with a friend of mine and I figured what the hell, I\\'ll give it a go. Im not really in the best of shape, especially as a vegan. I feel great and my bloodwork etc are all good, but I can\\'t seem to lose any weight. Too many grains and beans, which my system doesn\\'t do so hot with. \\nAt the gym my friend had me lift weights with him. He said we could do reps to figure out the max rather than overdoing it and likely causing an injury. I maxed benchpress at 375, curled 110, and legs 2000.\\nIf I wanted to really get into this, is vegan food going to be enough calories? Like I said beans and grains don\\'t do very well for my guts, and f&amp;v have hardly any calories. That leaves mushrooms and nuts and avocados...\\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \\nThanks for listening :)',\n",

What do you think will be the most effective? \\n\\nI think it would be best to focus on the ethical arguements before going onto environmental ones in another film another time. Earthlings is the only vegan documentary I've seen, or at least was able to watch up to a certain point. The problem that I have with Earthlings is that it opens with the pets segment, which I personally find one of the most distressing parts, but my partner already agrees in adopting animals, so I'm concerned we may not make it to the segment on animals used for food, which is the main bit I want us to see. There's also the issue with the footage being older and I believe mainly from the US, which opens up for false rationalisations that the scenes are irrelevant to our situation. The other documentaries I know of are Dominion and Land of Hope and Glory, which I think would be good since it's set in the UK where we are, but I'm not sure. \\n\\nWhat suggestions do you have? Which film do you think is the best to promote veganism? Thanks.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So, I tried these, the packaging said vegan (honest - didn\\'t have my glasses on at the grocery store, and saw all the rave reviews on this site), and then I read, \"natural flavors\" in the list of ingredients.  They also list, separately, \"vegan natural flavors\".  So, I called them.  \\n\\nThe rep I spoke to told me he was a 40 year vegan, that they were vegan certified (after watching seaspiracy, I am even more skeptical of \"certifications\"), and that it was probably a misprint, and also that he would send an email to someone to figure out the mistake and correct it. \\n\\nAll great, until I asked him to contact me with the particulars of his findings.  As in, what is the difference between natural flavors (read: chicken) and vegan natural flavors; and why they listed both. I am no dummy, I have been doing this for 35+ years. It is well known in the vegan community that \\'natural flavors\\' is a massive red flag. Labeling laws are there for a reason, and companies do their best to hide information that might appear off-putting to potential consumers. And packaging isn\\'t cheap - companies need to buy a minimum of 80,000 lots to get a small break on the printing of plastic; to not proofread ahead of time with this large of scale seems a bit off. \\n\\nSo, this is where the rep seemed to get defensive: \"can you email or call me when you find out what is going on with the labeling?\" response: \" I already cleared that up.\"  I pressed him a little more, and realized that he was not being cooperative and that I was wasting my time.  he cleared up that I was confused, which is bs, because the confusing label is why I called in the first place. \\n\\nI have NEVER seen labeling like this ever. There is a reason they listed flavorings twice, with 2 different headings.  I am not sure why. What are \\'natural vegan flavors\\', ground up vegans?  the packaging says vegan, but there is no sign anywhere of an oversight body, company, or whoever declared them to be vegan. certified by whom, exactly? \\n\\nI really want to believe the rep I spoke with, but the defensive posturing and refusal to clear up the confusion - or rather write it off as \" probably a packaging mistake\" and refusing to follow up smells like trouble.  If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, is labeled like a duck, and tastes like a duck...\\n\\nMy hope with posting here is to get help pressuring them for an answer, in writing.  The rep may very well be on this forum.  I look forward to hearing more.',\n",

[/u/YourVeganFallacyBot was created a couple years ago]( https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/igyqbq/two_years_ago_i_created_the_yourveganfallacybot/) \\n\\nSadly, this bot has gone inactive as it required the creator to manually approve all posts.\\n\\n/u/animalsupportbot will use MUCH more sophisticated methods of detecting vegan myths with the aim of running completely autonomously. This bot can be summoned to respond to any vegan myth you see on reddit, drastically reducing the time vegans take to respond to run of the mill arguments.\\n\\n# We need your help! \\n## Labelling \\nAlthough the bot is in a semi-working state right now with no training data, we really want this bot to perform better, and to do that, we need some reddit comments to be labelled. We\\'ve scraped around 18k comments from /r/antivegan and /r/exvegans and put them in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDue0zd00dYg0uaygXieDAJqFan4h1rSrNidQKQVz8A/edit#gid=0) for us to collaboratively label. For each comment in the spreadsheet, we\\'d like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. \\n\\n[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) \\n\\nIn most cases, the comments will be \"N/A\", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the \"Key Sentence(s)\" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I\\'m not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don\\'t feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don\\'t feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) \\n\\n## Arguments/Responses\\nIf you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn\\'t present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you\\'re willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. \\n\\n# Can I test it out now? \\nYes! You can check and test out how well it\\'s working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It\\'s good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) \\n\\n# How does animalsupportbot work? \\nThis is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn\\'t mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ \\n\\n# What arguments can it respond to? \\nCurrently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone\\'s favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)): \\n* Can You Love Animals and Eat Them? \\n*  It\\'s My Personal Choice To Eat Animals! \\n*   I Love How Animals Taste! \\n*    Animals Eat Other Animals \\n*    Veganism Is Unhealthy \\n*    It\\'s Cultural and Traditional to Eat Animals \\n*    Our Ancestors Ate Animals \\n*    If the World Went Vegan, What Would Happen to the Animals? \\n*    Human Rights Issues are More Important Than Veganism \\n*    Plants Feel Pain \\n*    Do Animals Feel Pain? \\n*    Humans Are at the Top of the Food Chain \\n*    We Are More Intelligent Than Animals \\n*    Why Farmed Animals Should be Grateful \\n*    Can\\'t We Just Improve the Welfare of Animals? \\n*    Morality is Subjective \\n*    Everything in Moderation \\n*    You Can\\'t Be 100% Vegan \\n*    What if a Vegan Was Stranded on a Desert Island? \\n*    Being Vegetarian is Enough \\n*    Hitler Was a Vegetarian/I Once Met a Mean Vegan \\n*    What About Farmer\\'s Jobs? \\n*    Eating Animals is the Circle of Life \\n*    Animals Are Bred to be Killed \\n*    Soya Farming is Destroying the Environment \\n*    Going Vegan is Expensive and Restrictive \\n*    We\\'re Omnivores/We Have Canine Teeth \\n*    My Friends and Family Will Judge me if I go Vegan \\n*    God Says That I Can Eat Animals \\n*    One Person Can\\'t Make a Difference You can view the response texts of these myths on [vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/) \\n\\nThank you!',\n",

For each comment in the spreadsheet, we\\'d like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. \\n\\n[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) \\n\\nIn most cases, the comments will be \"N/A\", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the \"Key Sentence(s)\" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I\\'m not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don\\'t feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don\\'t feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) \\n\\n## Arguments/Responses\\nIf you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn\\'t present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you\\'re willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. \\n\\n# Can I test it out now? \\nYes! You can check and test out how well it\\'s working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It\\'s good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) \\n\\n# How does animalsupportbot work? \\nThis is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn\\'t mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ \\n\\n# What arguments can it respond to? \\nCurrently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone\\'s favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)): \\n* Can You Love Animals and Eat Them? \\n*  It\\'s My Personal Choice To Eat Animals! \\n*   I Love How Animals Taste! \\n*    Animals Eat Other Animals \\n*    Veganism Is Unhealthy \\n*    It\\'s Cultural and Traditional to Eat Animals \\n*    Our Ancestors Ate Animals \\n*    If the World Went Vegan, What Would Happen to the Animals? \\n*    Human Rights Issues are More Important Than Veganism \\n*    Plants Feel Pain \\n*    Do Animals Feel Pain? \\n*    Humans Are at the Top of the Food Chain \\n*    We Are More Intelligent Than Animals \\n*    Why Farmed Animals Should be Grateful \\n*    Can\\'t We Just Improve the Welfare of Animals? \\n*    Morality is Subjective \\n*    Everything in Moderation \\n*    You Can\\'t Be 100% Vegan \\n*    What if a Vegan Was Stranded on a Desert Island? \\n*    Being Vegetarian is Enough \\n*    Hitler Was a Vegetarian/I Once Met a Mean Vegan \\n*    What About Farmer\\'s Jobs? \\n*    Eating Animals is the Circle of Life \\n*    Animals Are Bred to be Killed \\n*    Soya Farming is Destroying the Environment \\n*    Going Vegan is Expensive and Restrictive \\n*    We\\'re Omnivores/We Have Canine Teeth \\n*    My Friends and Family Will Judge me if I go Vegan \\n*    God Says That I Can Eat Animals \\n*    One Person Can\\'t Make a Difference You can view the response texts of these myths on [vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/) \\n\\nThank you!',\n",

I am simply making my point and asking for help on the matter, because I am seriously at a loss.) I now look at meat completely different (it\\'s just flesh from an animal that lived a very short and horrendous life). But when it comes to dairy and eggs, I cannot seem to look at them the same way. Now, before you scream at me, I am fully aware of the horrors behind the dairy and egg industry, and I am in no way justifying what happens to these animals who deserve a fulfilled life— eggs and milk are unethical period, no matter how it\\'s done.) What I am saying is that, though I oppose animal use of any kind, especially dairy, egg, and flesh industries, I find myself still being inconsistent. I don\\'t like it. I just never see the mother getting her baby taken away everytime I see there\\'s milk in a product; maybe it is because I am a selfish human being. I do not drink milk nor eggs, but sometimes I get lazy and I don\\'t bother to check ingredients, or I eat it anyway even when I KNOW it has these products.

It would really help if someone could give me some insight before you start saying, \"Oh, well you\\'re not a vegan then — you\\'re plant-based.\" I am not \"plant-based,\" and I want these animals free just as much as anyone else. But I find it hard to stay committed because I am just lazy and, as I said, I do not feel the remorse as I do with meat, and even real eggs, and real milk. It seems likes it\\'s an effort and selfishness issue on my part. Please tell me SOMEONE has got to relate to this at least a little bit. I know I love these animals, so why am I doing this?

For those unfamiliar, he discusses a variety of topics, notably theology and philosophy, but touches on veganism quite often as well. \\n\\nIt’s fair to say that until recently, I never really gave the concept of veganism much thought, as most people do, or rather *don’t* do, I suppose. To get straight to the point, I’m experiencing some personal struggle in this regard. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same. I guess I’m seeking some guidance in my direction from here. \\n\\nI think there’s strong case to be made for veganism on moral grounds in regards to the suffering of animals; notably, I have a problem with the current state of the food industry. This is largely propagated by a life changing awakening I’ve had in recent months, that paints a much bigger picture. I won’t go into too much detail on that for now since it’s not 100% applicable, but briefly: I am experiencing a growing resentment for the total reliance on the modern system we’ve been set up to live by, and only by it (that being big industries and corporations). This includes, especially, the food industry.\\n\\nSo on the topic of the meat industry, our population numbers have increased so much in recent centuries that we no longer have a need to hunt for food. We breed and manufacture animals for the sole purpose of eating them, and often times these facilities lack proper oversight, you’ve seen the videos of the undercover investigations. It’s horrific. It’s unnatural. \\n\\nSo where do I stand in all of this? I feel a growing guilt for consuming manufactured meat. I could simply stop eating it, but it’s difficult to do when I’m surrounded by people who do eat manufactured meat and have zero problem with it. As it stands, I recognize our omnivorous nature, and I recognize the natural state of the world. There’s always going to be an impersonal, uncaring, necessary balance between predator and prey. That said, I don’t think I would have a problem with consuming meat, so long as I am the one that hunts, and does so correctly so as to not cause any undue suffering to an animal. I also don’t see a problem in utilizing an animal’s resources as long as they don’t suffer in the process. \\n\\nThis is a process, so please don’t bash me for holding these opinions. It’s why I’m here, to seek knowledge, understanding, to think things all the way through, free of fallacy, and most importantly, to be the best version of myself I can be. \\n\\nThank you for any input you have.

Cows can only be in a field for a couple days before the grass is used up, if they're not managed they won't get enough grass. If they are let to roam free cows will be breaking into peoples land, running on roads, in peoples front lawns to get grass. \\n\\nAlso what do you do in the winter? In temperate climate countries grass doesn't grow in winter all the cows would literally die they'd have nothing to eat. They are completely reliant on farmers to feed them in the winter. \\n\\nAlso think about newborn calves. Besides the fact cows need help sometimes to calve, when they are born they would not survive the nights in autumn, winter or even spring as those nights are cold. And again you have the problem of if the calf is drinking the correct milk, too much or too little. And new calves easily get sick they need different supplements which they wouldn't get.\\n\\nAlso even if those calves survived, in a couple years you have a bunch of bulls running around freely. Bulls are dangerous.\\n\\nAll of this needs to be managed. So they need to be owned by a farmer on a farm. I don't see how they can be allowed to roam freely.\",\n",

I recently accepted a new job (I am a bartender) at a bar which has been absolutely great, although the building is rather old. Why that's worth bringing up is because it allows the entry of at least several mice. You can probably imagine the attitude towards them harboured by the nonvegan management (who are honestly good people, just not ones who happen to be vegan).   \\n\\n\\nI am vegan myself and love animals. But, I am also aware of the sanitation issues they present in this case, which are made even more pressing in an environment such as a restaurant or bar, so I am really torn on this one. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe management has set up traps around the place, which is painful enough for me to see, but my biggest point of contention is that they are using glue traps to get the poor little guys who just wanted to come in from the cold and eat some pub food (don't we all?). I am sure I don't need to tell you how horribly and gratuitously cruel those things are.   \\n\\n\\nI am just wondering, as a vegan, what is the course of action I should take that best balances practicality and compassion? I know welfarism is seen by many vegans as a tepid half measure against animal suffering, which I have nuanced feelings about, but maybe I could at least get them to use a quicker acting trap, or ideally something much much much more humane in place of that horrendous way to die. Only catch is, nobody else there is vegan, and we all know how much people traditionally sympathise with mice (or the idea of doing anything a vegan says), so I feel like this will be an uphill climb. Furthermore, I am, as I said, very new at my job, and I must admit I would ideally like to evade being labelled as 'that guy' who gets a new job and then feels entitled to tell the management how to run their business. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm sure I have forgotten pertinent details, but that's all I have for now.

The extra work of seeking out the label isn't a big deal, but I'm worried that the label I find online will be different from what is on the actual product, if that makes sense?\\n* Eating out at restaurants that aren't fully vegan. Thankfully I have two AMAZING fully vegan restaurants close to my home, and a ton of places with vegan options. But I'm foreseeing situations like I was in Saturday: out shopping with a friend and we made a split decision on lunch. It was a local mexican restaurant, and I got veggie fajitas without sour cream. But I worry about the ingredients in like the tortillas and the refried beans. How do y'all handle this?\\n* My in-laws are pretty awful and don't make it a point to accomodate me when we visit, but I have no problem bringing my own veggie burgers or whatever and eating sides that everyone else is having. But that will change a bit when I'm vegan vs. lacto-ovo veg. Anyone have similar issues? Do you just bring your own food because that's how I'm leaning.\",\n",

I am currently in my senior year and would be graduating in about a month. My university is in small town in the South where, being a predominantly conservative state, my only viable options to shop for grocery are Walmart and Kroger. There are no vegan restaurants around me either. I live with 3 roommates who are all meat eaters, and we often buy common food items together (like buying a 20 lbs bag of rice and sharing it between us). Also, although this may go without saying, I'm hella broke. \\n\\nNow, I have recently watched a couple documentaries on the ethical, health and environmental aspect of animal agriculture, and I am completely convinced that I want to go vegan. I am not overly health conscious. However, I think I would like to make nutritional completeness a goal in my transition to veganism. The purpose of this post is to get some help from any of you, if possible, with some roadblocks: \\n\\n1. I have a taste preference for my traditional foods. Think Indian veg food with the addition of small portions of fish (which is mostly added for flavor as well as protein) and other non-veg Indian items like chicken Tikka masala and such. I'm considering replacing the fish in the traditional vegetable dishes with some other kind of protein that's relatively cheap (maybe adds some flavor too?). What would be some of my options? \\n2. I watched some videos suggesting that I buy legumes, nuts, beans and whole grain from whole food stores where I can get the exact amount I need. Having no whole food stores near me, what would be my option to include these ingredients in my food? \\n3. What are some good vegan snacks that would be comparable to hot Cheetos, or Lay's kettle-cooked jalapeno chips? Are there any popular brand name chips that are vegan? \\n4. Please also include any tips, if you have any, to save money on grocery trips. \\n\\nThank you!\",\n",

Almost everytime I visit my mother in law says 'I'm glad at least you're not vegan'.  I visited now again for Easter and brought a vegan quiche for dinner but she decided to also serve a giant dish with heaps of salmon, and also lamb. Fucking lamb on Easter, how horrible can you be.. After dinner I cried my eyes out and I really don't know what to do, even after almost 5 years I still have to bring my own food because they will simply not make anything I can eat. How do you guys do this?? It's so hard to keep visiting even though I know I will return feeling sick for having to look at so many dead animals\",\n",

I had always said the food is the easiest part, what\\'s challenging of being vegan is other people. I\\'ve been mocked, insulted and judged, people had called me names, even friends and family. And mind you, I\\'ve never been agressive or \"pushy\" or anything, I believe \"forcing\" people doesn\\'t work because people have to make the connection themselves in order to have a permanent and genuine change, but I speak about my convictions if asked. People always feel attacked so for a time I just smiled and keep my thoughts for myself (not anymore, but that\\'s another topic).\\n\\nAnyways. I\\'ve had a couple of boyfriends through that time. One was abusive and used to mock me, and the other one tried to \"comply\" with the \"issue\" and it felt it (I) was an inconvinience (we sometimes went to vegan restaurants but he still ate animals when we were together, he also said he could be vegan for me in the future if we lived together, but that didn\\'t sit right with me because I didn\\'t want to be the reason).\\n\\nAnyways, I began a new relationship on May last year. He is amazing, honestly I didn\\'t think I could be this happy. Guys, I found the one. He\\'s the most intelligent, the sweetest, the kindest, the funniest, the sexiest. He isn\\'t vegan, but he respects I am and from day one, he has cooked and eaten plant based whenever we are together. I had an amazing birthday, Christmas and new years eve feast. We share recipes and experiment with food. It is great. \\n\\nFor the first time in my life, I feel that I can truly be myself with someone. He listens, we often debate and try to see things from the other one\\'s prespective. So I just share my thoughts whever I see something that angers me or frustrates me, I vent to him. And he is always there for me. \\n\\nThis week he told me he started reading some things about animal rights, so I decided to give him my copy of DeGrazia\\'s introduction to the topic (amazing book, it changed my life, I strongly recommend it). I didn\\'t think much about it. Then today we had a picnic (with safe precautions) and I shared my thoughts on the videos of a vegan youtuber that had made me question my approach to veganism. I think I have to change the \"pick me vegan\" behaviors I sometimes have. Anyways, he listened and then he told me he hasn\\'t consumed animals since last Tuesday. He told me he has always thought there was something wrong about  animal product-food and now that he isn\\'t eating it, he feels a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. Although he thanked me for speaking about the topic, he isn\\'t doing it for me, but for the right reasons, the animals. His journey has started and I feel the luckiest woman in this planet.\\n\\nI always thought I couldn\\'t be with someone in the long run if they weren\\'t vegan. Anti-speciesism is as important for me as anti-racism or anti-sexism or anti-homophobia. Discrimination is all the same for me and being against it is a fundamental part of my identity, so I always wished for someone who shared my same values. And I found him. I\\'m just so happy.\\n\\nI\\'m so proud of him, and if you happen to read this, I love you A.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I have been slightly overweight for probably 6-7 years and I started counting calories and realised I was eating like 1800-2500 calories a day (as a 5'7 woman). I'm currently living a sedentary lifestyle so have been eating 1400 calories max the past 2 weeks and have already lost 4-5lbs! \\n\\nAbout 8 months ago I was getting dizzy so I started taking a multi-vitamin and have been fine since then. I tried to stop taking the multi-vitamin once and the dizziness came back so that further confirmed that I was lacking something even when I was eating a lot of calories. However, since I've been eating 1400 calories I am still taking my multi-vitamin, but now my dizziness is back. It specifically happens whenever I stand up. \\n\\nI'm using myfitnesspal and I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate, but according to it I seem to not be getting enough of several nutrients, particularly protein and iron. Seems as though I get around 25-40g of protein a day. I'm not really sure what to do as I feel like my diet is pretty healthy, so I don't know how to add more nutrients without adding more calories.\\n\\nTo give insight into how I usually eat:\\n\\nBreakfast - fruit and nut bar\\n\\nLunch - usually some variation of a salad. Ingredients I use often include avocado, falafel, chickpeas, beans, spinach, cucumber, etc. Sometimes I'll have a lentil and vegetable soup with bread instead.\\n\\nDinner - sometimes i'll have a bean and mince  chilli with avocado, sometimes cheesy pasta with spinach, sometimes tofu and chickpea curry, sometimes a lentil cottage pie w/ veg, etc.\\n\\nSnacks - I usually have 1-2 snacks a day including stuff like choc rice cakes, quinoa chips, pretzels w/ peanut butter, popcorn, yoghurt, etc.\\n\\nWhen I look up what vegan foods are high in protein or high in iron I see all the foods that I eat every day/week so I don't understand what to do. I eat 1400 calories as this is what is recommended to me, but could this recommendation only be good if it's a omni diet? Am I meant to eat more calories as a vegan? Will I still be able to lose weight if so?\\n\\nBtw - I've been vegan for 4 years and I've never noticed being consistently dizzy/tired until about a year ago before I started taking the multi-vitamin.\",\n",

You have your opinions and we have ours.\" So while they\\'re sitting eating lamb or veal and I just don\\'t say a word, they still don\\'t know why I\\'m upset? Then they\\'ll keep asking, \"What\\'s bothering you? I know you! I know you\\'re upset about something!!!\" What do you want me to answer?\\n\\nIf I say, \"I\\'m upset because of the animal abuse,\" they\\'ll say that\\'s just an opinion. \"You can\\'t let yourself get upset about that, you always ruin our fun, we\\'re just trying to celebrate and have a good time!\" I\\'m not allowed to be sad that you celebrate life and special occasions by killing babies? \\n\\nThey\\'ve many times told me I\\'m not allowed to talk about it and they get mad when I do, and their answer is always the same: \"That\\'s just your opinion! Opinions are subjective, you can\\'t tell us how to live our lives. Live and let live. I respect your choice to be vegan, you should respect our choice not to!\"\\n\\nAnd yet, the other day I decided (in the privacy of my own home while eating in front of the couch) to lick my plate. My sister looked at me and said \"That\\'s disgusting!\" \\n\\nSo to maybe give her an idea, I said \"Well that\\'s just your opinion! You can\\'t tell me how to live my life. I respect your choice not to lick plates, respect my choice to do it!\" She could not believe what she heard, like I was some kind of crazy person, and said to me, **\"Well SOME things are OBJECTIVELY wrong!\"** \\n\\nHmm, so violently killing a baby animal is just a subjective opinion that doesn\\'t concern anyone but you and me, but which utensil I decide to touch with my mouth based on arbitrary social mores is \"objective\"? \\n\\nIt bugs me because they always tell me what to do, and say something is \"rude,\" and constantly judge everything I do. But when I even get upset and don\\'t say a word because of systematic mass slaughter, I\\'m out of line and no one should ever judge. Every single thing they think is worthy of judging people for seems like *nothing* compared to the seriousness of what the meat industry is doing to the world, and yet they *laugh* making fun of vegans in mocking voices going \"mEaT iS mUrDeR HAHAHAHAHAHAHA BUNCH OF CRAZIES 😂\"\\n\\nAnother thing that happened is when I go grocery shopping to buy vegan stuff and my mom asks me to pick up some meat or dairy. I\\'ve told her many times why I\\'m not comfortable doing that, and even asked her what she would do if someone asked her to go kill a dog for her, saying \"You don\\'t have to *eat* it, it\\'s not for *you*, don\\'t be selfish!\" And yet nope, she still thinks I\\'m selfish for \"literally forcing\" my views on her. Last time I said no, she says to me, **\"I understand you have your opinions and you\\'re very passionate, but sometimes you have to put your beliefs aside and do the right thing!\"**\\n\\n\"The right thing\" is killing baby animals, and my \"belief\" is that I don\\'t personally like it? She doesn\\'t realize I could say the exact same thing to her, right? Put *your* beliefs (that 5 minutes of enjoyment on your tastebuds is a good reason to kill a baby animal) aside, and do the right thing (leave them alone).\\n\\nSometimes I want to give up hope and feel useless.\\n\\nTL;DR Everything a meat-eater believes is considered \"objective\" or \"neutral,\" and all the facts we try to express are just \"beliefs,\" \"opinions,\" or even \"just like religion.\"',\n",

I scheduled a doctors appointment and they said an alternative was a antibiotic in a tablet form, however it was not as effective and has a high risk of developing resistance to antibiotics, which the Lymecycline does not. I really don’t want to take the capsules but I have been for the last couple days but to be honest I have felt like crap and it’s weighing in my mind a lot... any opinions on what you would do?',\n",

They've been laying eggs and I've been wondering what I will do if one falls sick or passes of natural causes. I'm curious as to what this community feels about that, before I make assumptions. It clearly disobey the vegan standards but its the biologically correct thing to do - the eggs would rot and make the birds sick eventually as they are not broody. I feel like it's instantly and completely undermined my support for veganism but again I don't want to make assumptions. What do you think?\\nThanks!\",\n",

Definitely more swayed by it lately personally but it didn’t convince me initially so I wouldn’t call myself an ethical vegan. \\n\\nSo many great reasons, so much data and philosophy. There is however one group I looks down on abs honestly I dislike more and more the longer I’m vegan. “Icky” vegans. \\n\\nOh you think meat is icky? \\n\\nIt all started when you tried to cook a stake and the tissue at the bottom of the packet was dripping in blood? Hahaha yeah so funny how you only ate stake at restaurants because of that before giving it up all together.\\n\\nReally liked drum sticks until you bit a blood vessel and you can’t look at chicken nuggets the same way? \\n\\nDid you know that sausage are sometimes made using pig intestines? Ewwwwww so gross that when an animal is eaten all of it at least gets fucking used rather than thrown away to rot for its suffering. Hahahah yeah right gross. \\n\\nYou used to eat cheese all the time, yum how could you live without it right, none of that stinky stuff though hahaha gross mould am I right? Then one day you left you’re really expensive cheddar at the back of the fridge and part of it froze and the other part went all fuzzy after you got back from holiday. Hahah yeah it’s a lot of money to loose, can’t look at any cheese the same way anymore though right? Mould hahaha gross yeah. \\n\\nYou just don’t like dairy and think it’s gross now that you know puss gets in it? That a stupid reason, it was just as puss filled when you last had it. \\n\\nYou just think that killing an animal is icky, no problem with the death of its desire to live, it’s poor living conditions, is being a product, no no no just that killing is icky. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re not a vegan your just upset knowing how you’re food gets made.',\n",

I turned 21 years old 3 months ago and that’s when he contacted me, explaining how he wish he was a vegan, he actually cared about the animals, and realized he can be completely healthy and even more healthy as a side effect of being vegan. That’s when I decided we should live together. We have been helping each other create a vegan life together ever since he moved into my apartment, we really haven’t looked back since. He learned how to cook and prepare vegan meals, and even started making me food. After he cut out dairy a lot of his back pain cleared up and his energy improved.

Society has made it easy to ignore, so thank you for paying attention and not participating in carnism as far as possible and practicable. Our culture has been formed in a way that cruelty has become so common and acceptable that anyone who attempts to avoid supporting it is seen as irrational or strange.\\n\\nThank you for being vegan and daring to imagine, to see and to hear the horror that no one else wants to acknowledge.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Okay. Is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it, noticing that all your “excuses” seemingly align with vegan outcomes?\\n\\nIn terms of health...I watched my father die of cancer. It broke me. Every time I see the animal products he consumed a lot of....I think of the agony he went through in the last stages of his life....and I can’t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again...so I immediately go for whole food plants to hopefully prevent it.\\n\\nA lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line. While I disagree with them, I’m not a doctor so I don’t know how educated I am on the topic, so I stay quiet.\\n\\nMy father got cancer. His father got cancer. Both died in their 50s long before they should have... both the kindness members of the family... sad face.\\n\\nEveryone (in former associations I had with them, when we would regularly eat together... we don’t do it anymore because of ... reasons... see profile for irrelevant explanation of that...) heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic.\\n\\nThing is.... they eat so much god dam meat. Every meal: \\nMeat: red meat; fish; chicken; or some other former sentient animals flesh.\\n\\nSo much bacon. Ungodly amounts of bacon. So much so, that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup (she’s the only one who I told I was plant based. But she’s not the brightest person and never understood it, so this wasn’t intentional on her part, trust me): she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it. Thinking it was fine since it was only a bit.\\n\\nDairy: cheese, so much god dam cheese; milk; \\n\\nWhen I was a young child I naturally consumed The same foods, up until about 15.\\n\\nLooking back, my symptoms were INSANE and really bad, such that I’m surprised I never considered the food I was eating could be causing me to have these issues.\\n\\nRashes: EVERYWHERE. For arms. Shins. Oh my god dam fingers. Bottom of my feet. It was so bad. Even when I didn’t scratch it would get worse, and when I did scratch I’d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point. “It’s only that bad because you scratch. If you stopped it would go away. (Nah it’s not the food at all). I’d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up.)\\n\\nCravings: I’d go through non stop physical shakes if I didn’t  have dairy products 3 times a week. My loving father had to limit My ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because I was ballooning up. But i was always trying... my best.. I swear... but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until I gave in.\\n\\nDepression and fatigue. NON STOP FATIGUE. I’d be told by family that I just wasn’t eating enough, them proudly patting their ballooned stomach. I forced myself to eat more of the garbage food. I definitely ate more, but my fatigue got worse and I gained weight \\n\\n\\nAll of this is to just show.. how sick and tired I was of my health feeling like garbage. So I stoped. I told family My decision to just limit (l said lying, knowing i wasn’t eating any behind closed doors) animal products. So please , if they cook, just give me the non animal based parts of the meal.  I’d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho, they had to do NOTHING extra.\\n\\nFirst: they asked why. I explained that I was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms. They told me I was being silly, it wasn’t the food. And that I needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods, it’s in our DNA!\\n\\nSecond: when the above strategy did not work, and it became clear that for about 2 months I had not gave up (skin improving before their eyes. But they ignored that, claiming I was just not scratching... I was still scratching a lot. They didn’t believe me). They tried a new strategy: guilt tripping me.\\n\\nThey told me I could 100% “cheat” 1 day a week and my health would be fine. When I told them “cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure, and I don’t get pleasure from the side effects I do still get after eating it, so I don’t “cheat” with foods that cause pain... they god mad.\\n\\n“Oh. So your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it? Wow.”\\n\\n“No. I do eat the food she makes. See, I’m right now eating plain pasta. L\\n\\n“It’s rude to not eat everything. You are insinuating she’s doing a bad job and making you sick. That’s rude”\\n\\n“What? No, I’m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work. And if I add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative. “\\n\\n“I disagree. It’s rude. “\\n\\n“(Seeing no other way out, I lied) my doctor told me to do this. Are you telling me I should ignore my doctor? “\\n\\nThis shut down all complaints. Once I tied it into “my doctor told me to do this”, they had a difficult time arguing back that I’m being rude. Although they did try, and the sane people at the table would go \\n\\n“dude. Does OP tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended? “\\n\\n“That’s not the same thing. This is food not medication.”\\n\\n“I specifically heard you tell me your doctor told YOU not to eat X food groups and you wouldn’t need to take the anti acid pills. So unless you want us to judge YOU for ignoring doctors orders, leave op alone” (GO. GRANDMA. LOVE YOU. SO MUCH... even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad. But you stopped when I asked you not to, so we gucchi).\\n\\nSo....I know that was a long rant. But. My point: when I lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family, or awful people in general... it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life. I don’t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up. But, is lying unethical, and contributing to the problem even more, and I should be willing to take the hostility ?\\n\\nWhen my family suspected I’d become vegan, the anger was INSANE. They literally told me I was lying to do them for X, Y, and Z reasons. They went off on how I was judging them for their choices and I needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food. And until I finally lied, telling them it was my doctors advice.... they kept getting worse.\\n\\nNow. I am away from those family members now. But.... I just dont think I can handle the hostility associated with activism. But I can not contribute to the problem. Is this okay?',\n",

For those of you who are aware of your iron levels and are consciously trying to raise them or simply maintain them; what supplement do you take? \\n\\nI’ve been taking Spatone but it’s a measly 5mg so that likely won’t help me much.

I am super Happy right now! I heard that a new food store opened in my city and because everything exciting is closed due to the panini, I decided to visist that store and... I have to say it was worth leaving the house! I found that that store has an in house sushi bar that sells vegan sushi! Freshly made sushi that you can order, they prepare it infront of you and you can take it home directly. \\n\\nEven though its not from a restaurant... it was the best sushi I ever had, by far! I had rolls with avocado, rolls with cucumber, rolls with avocado, cucumber and red pepper and one rice roll stuffed in... I thing it was vegan \"duck\"? Haha, sorry for not naming the rolls correctly, I always forget the naming for the different shapes... but yeah. This literally made my day after not being able to eat lunch, I now had this tasty box :)',\n",

The problem now is that she’s saying that she doesn’t really have any interest in being vegan anymore and that when the UK lockdown is over in a couple months she’s almost definitely going to go vegetarian because when she’s out and about with friends and stuff her options are way too limited and she probably wouldn’t be able to find food, and idk i think it’s kind of bullshit. it seems like such a tiny problem that could be really easily solved by either making your own food and bringing it out (a bit of a hassle i know) or just going with something you don’t want to eat as much as a non-vegan option but you’ll make do because it’s still good food.it’s also that she says she PROBABLY won’t be able to find food, she doesn’t even know for sure... i feel like i shouldn’t be so personally upset by this, especially because i don’t feel this annoyed about my family eating meat? but if feels like a real bummer and almost a betrayal?? cause she seemed so passionate about the ethics and wellbeing of animals being very anti-cruelty and pro-not-killing-the-environment and now she’s like “ah fuck it life is easier for little old me when i don’t always have to only eat plant based” and it feels like she thinks her convenience is more important that the literal lives of animals and that it seems to go back on the values she’s seemed to have since turning vegan :( i’m probably overreacting i’m just really worked up about it especially because i don’t want to bring it up with her for fear of sounding like a proper asshole/ like i’m controlling her so i’m just bottling it up i guess?? \\n\\ntl;dr My sister has been vegan since november and says that when UK lockdown is over in june she’s almost definitely going to turn vegetarian because it’ll PROBABLY be too difficult to find vegan food when she’s out with friends or something. i’m upset about this for obvious reasons and idk if i should i bring it up with her or just let it go🤷\\u200d♂️',\n",

Add chili seasoning, and any other Mexican type seasoning you like. Place in the over just to toast it. I like to toast my tacos a little too! Add some lime!\\n\\nChickpea (tuna fish) sandwich: in place of tuna, I use chickpeas. I like to toast, so same as above but once the chickpeas and onions are toasted, mix it with vegan Mayo in a bowl. Then make your sandwiches\\n\\nPesto: spinach, basil, nutritional yeast, walnuts -\\nBlend and can be used as a dip or on any type of pasta noodles. Add tofu too!\\n\\nBlack beans or pinto beans on rice, sometimes I put it on brown rice or quinoa. No explanation. Add potatoes!\\n\\nMiddle Eastern Bowl: chickpeas (or green lentils)  on couscous or rice or quinoa. Add humus and any veggies you like. I also add sweet potatoes or potatoes \\n\\nPeanut butter and banana sandwich: self explanatory. I put it on whole wheat toast \\n\\nGreen lentils on quinoa or couscous: I boil some water, add some salt and then when it boils, I add the lentil, cover and turn down to low and let it sit for 30 minutes. So simple, one of my favs. \\n\\n**I always add flax or hemp seeds on my food',\n",

I overall agree with the sentiment that animal lives have intrinsic value and the fact that 8% of the population is vegan is enough to convince me to participate. I believe that if that number continues to grow, the animal agriculture industry will die out or become obscure and as a communist, all exploitation is bad, including towards animals.\\n\\nWhile I don’t particularly like animals, I recognize that they are Living for beings who experience pain, love and deserve a life beyond being used for consumption.  \\n\\nHowever, I have autism, and I am an extremely picky eater.\\n\\nWhen I say picky, I am not just talking about textures, I haven’t eaten a piece of fruit since I was in elementary school and most vegetables make me gag. I also can barley stomach salads and you couldn’t even pay me to eat that kind of stuff. There are very few textures I Can actually tolerate and a lot of vegan recipes admittedly kind of look like dogshit. \\n\\nI would have no problem actually cutting out stuff like meat (I hate the taste of milk and yogurt so I don’t eat those, but I do eat a lot of cheese). But finding healthy substitutes to those things is the difficult part—especially since I live in an area that doesn’t really have many supermarkets, yet alone vegan options. \\n\\nSeafood would also be a big problem for me since it’s one of the only proteins/sources of B-12 I get and I am going to be honest, I really like seafood. I also really love cheese and seafood and cheese are stuff that even from some vegans, say that the vegan replacements don’t taste good. \\n\\nOne saving factor would be the fact I am obsessed with mushrooms and I could easily cut out all meat and replace it with mushrooms, but mushrooms alone doesn’t make up a balanced diet. \\n\\nThis has just been circling my mind a lot and I don’t know if anyone is going to notice this, but yeah.',\n",

I went vegetarian (which I know is not the same) about a year ago, but unfortunately had to go back to eating chicken (please don’t hate me, my mom and doctor both said I needed more protein) because I got very ill due to being malnourished. I wasn’t getting enough protein in my diet, despite eating lentils, beans, nuts, and other things. I even opted for some vegan patties, nuggets, pizza, and other things while being vegetarian. I absolutely HATED eating any thing with a beating heart. I still do. I feel guilty every time I eat chicken or any other meat. \\n\\nMy mom supports me through everything, so if I told her I wanted to go vegan, she wouldn’t mind, I would just have to do intense research to make sure I don’t become malnourished again. The only issue is, my entire family eats meat... so whenever I have dieted, exercised, or even when I was vegetarian, I was the only one in my household. It was hard at first, but I just stopped craving meat and such. It is hard to do’s nothing remotely different when you’re in a house with people who don’t care about the meat industry and stuff. I guess they just aren’t as educated as I am. \\n\\nI really have a hard time finding foods I like. Or foods that are good. Or being full enough. I don’t want that to happen, because we all know that being hungry sucks. I really wanted to make a post to ask for any advice, recipes, motivation, and stuff like that, so I can start REALLY supporting my environment, animals, and my body better. I really want this, but I am nervous. \\n\\nThank you in advance!',\n",

That focus be shift to singling out the methods for which meat is harvested? No I don\\'t mean in a \"-and this is why you shouldn\\'t eat meat\" way, because that doesn\\'t address the problem directly.\\nA person could go vegan today and still millions of animals will be killed tomorrow because everyone else isn\\'t vegan. So what I mean is, attacking their methods directly.\\n\\nVegans could address their methods with the purpose of forcing a change to alternative methods that meet a supposed humane criteria. A method that is used to, theortically bring suffering and torture to zero if not the bare minimum. For starters its known that the methods they currently use are optimized for mass production, not for the regard of animals at all..\\nIf these methods are approached with the sense of bettering the production instead of shutting it down (which is also the ultimate goal.) .. This will impact production value. As most ways to mass kill for demand won\\'t meet the bare minimum of suffering criteria that has been set.\\n\\nThis should get support as most people don\\'t support the suffering and torture of animals. So if a petition is started perhaps signatures would be bountiful if that reason is expressed for changes in regulation.\\n\\nIf it goes as expected, the prices of meat will rise due to new regulations of more attentive killings of animals. More attentive meaning more time consuming, less is being able to be produced.. The only option to compensate is hire more people, which eats away at the businesses money. The only way to compensate THAT is higher the prices. \\nWith prices going up, less people will buy or be able to buy, which would effectively put a dent in production value would it not?\\n\\nThis also ties into the forceful impregnation of animals. If you could prove in court that it is no different from the rape of a real animals by human hands (which is already illegal). You could forcibly change regulation to only have breedings done naturally. \\nIf the animals are being stressed out constantly and tortured, the last thing they are going to want to do is breed. That would indefinitely slow down production and make meat a rarity. Something not a lot of people could buy.\\n\\nAnyway these realizations just happened to pop into my head and I wanted to share. Ultimately I think the approach is good in the long run.',\n",

I’ve been making plant based meals every now and then, and I buy so many vegetables!” She then said how most vegans are super unhealthy because they’re “junk-food vegans”, and that if I did go vegan “one day”, she’d make sure I wasn’t “one of those vegans”.

And it didn't pop back and I realized I had killed it.\\n\\nThat's as far as I remember but apparently I screamed really loud and my mom ran out because she literally thought I was being kidnapped or something. I was so inconsolable that I had hurt the lady bug... And clearly it was more than just childish overdramatization considering it's like my first memory. \\n\\nIdk it just makes me think that if we could let kids make their own choices they would never eat meat. It isn't in our nature to want to hurt animals at all. I also wanted to stop eating meat when I was a bit older and realized that people ate ducks and that the chicken I ate was animal parts...\\n\\nDoes anyone else have moments like that where looking back you can see that you had a sort of vegan ethical framework from the start?\",\n",

Let me give some info and then you tell me if I’m evil😂\\n\\nI adopted a friend’s chickens last summer. They were getting ready to move and couldn’t find a home for them so they were going to kill them and eat them. I was mortified so I took them in. They get tons of veggies, fruit, snacks, love, safety from local predators, space to roam, and access to their eggs for days at a time in case they need the nutrients from their eggs that they would normally eat in the wild. Whatever is leftover we’ve always eaten or shared with neighbors. They’re super friendly and come up to you for love and treats.\\n\\nOne person said that they should be set free but I can 100% promise you they would die in the wild.\\n\\nIs it wrong to eat the leftover eggs that the chickens don’t eat themselves? Obviously you’re not vegan then, but at least your not supporting factory farming. Sooooo am I evil? Lol taking care of them and getting to know their little personalities has been so amazing and eye-opening. Anyone who spends time with chickens can tell you that they’re amazing animals.',\n",

I understand the type of white vegan that people are describing when they have a negative feeling to the term - I am probably more plant based than vegan because I don’t think I am 100% vigilant about every thing I use in my life, so this is more out of curiosity of people’s thoughts than personal reasons anyway. I think at the end of the day animal abuse / extinction and enviornmental damages are the primary concern, so if someone is passionate about industry issues but has some farm animals they use or goes fishing I am not probably going to talk down to them when discussing the matter. But it seems like when people say why they chose to go vegan and share some information about some issues, people get very upset and say that they are on a high horse, even if they asked why they don’t eat dairy or whatever. Any thoughts on this? Shouldn’t there be more focus on food accessibility in different areas and communities than demonizing not eating animal products?',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'More pros outweigh the cons to being vegan, and I did so for ethical reasons, but there are two cons that I’m really struggling to overcome:\\n\\n1. How expensive it is when lacking the time or motivation to cook.\\n2. How easy it is to not get sufficient nutrients/calories.\\n\\nThe last year and a half I’ve been struggling with the calories factor. I’ve tried eating more peanut butter, avocados, olive oil, etc., but maybe I’m just crazy and can’t eat like that every day, multiple times a day\\n\\nAt this point, I feel like I’m too depressed to be motivated for basic upkeep of myself. As a result, my periods became so irregular, and I’ve lost so much weight and cannot gain it back. I’m almost borderline underweight. \\n\\nSo I resorted to ordering food delivery literally everyday (I don’t have a car to do takeout and the spots I can eat at are not within walking distance), with a mixture of groceries because I don’t want to have strictly delivery. I’ve spent at least $3k in those 5 months on this, maybe even $4k. So I’ve been getting more calories in and my period went back to being regular. 28 days on the dot for 5 months straight. But my pockets are shot when I’m supposed to be saving to move out.\\n\\nSo the past few of months, I’ve been trying to force myself to cook and eat, and this is quick or easy kind of foods (throw it in an oven, microwave, etc.) but I don’t think anyone understands how hard these basic tasks are for me, especially if I need to cook more nutrient-dense, calorie-heavy foods. Plus, I can’t stomach even half as much home-cooked meals than I can with delivery. I get full fast, and half the time I lose my appetite altogether. \\n\\nPeople keep telling me to just start meal prep, toss food in a slow cooker, eat this, eat that, do X, Y, and Z. It’s not about what to do, it’s the effort. Now I feel so much pressure and like a failure because these basic tasks are no-brainers for the average person. But it’s a difficult chore for me.\\n\\nStill, 3 months later trying to eat from home, and I thought I was doing good with it, but I’m still not eating enough calories. Some days I eat 2-3 times a day and only manage &lt;1k calories, some days I only eat once or not at all.\\n\\nAnd now my period is late. Last month, my period came early at 26 days. I knew what this meant, and I’ve been trying to eat more, but now I’m 1 day late and still don’t feel the signs that it’s coming yet. This is what my periods have looked like in the past year: https://imgur.com/a/Mg9lKMV\\n\\nEating was a lot easier before I was vegan, because all the processed and fast food was cheap if need be while providing all the calories. Then I’d just take multivitamins. \\n\\nBut being vegan is proving extremely difficult for me, and I’m hating myself so much for it. I went vegan for ethical reasons, so I simply cannot stomach the idea of eating animals, and I’m still struggling with eating enough. \\n\\nI’m not sure why I’m even writing here, but if anyone has words to share, I’d really appreciate it.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I’ll start this off by making this clear: I’m on your side, I want your cause to succeed. Please read the rest of this post with this in mind, and approach it with open-mindedness and self-awareness.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDuring the past decade, veganism has become a viable, mainstream alternative to the traditional western omnivore diet, it is now more accepted than ever and its benefits are backed up by science. However, it still isn’t something completely normalized especially in developing countries and there’s still a lot of work left to do for environmental and vegan activists.\\n\\nNow, in my opinion, the reason why this uphill battle is so much more difficult than it should be is that mainstream vegan activism is so overly aggressive that it turns potential “allies” into disassociated, indifferent assets. PETA, for better or worse, is the face of the vegan brand around the world, and its marketing approach is horrendously hostile, actively insulting people. Listen to this, You will NEVER change someone’s mind when you start a conversation with “You are wrong, stupid, and a bad person; here’s why…” call it immaturity, overly sensitivity, whatever, that fact remains true. That’s the same reason why climate change awareness is so difficult to get across people’s minds, very few people have the ability to be that introspective and take that amount of personal responsibility, to sacrifice something without a tangible reward for them.\\n\\nYou are right. You have the truth and the moral high ground on your side. Use that responsibly, use it as a tool and not as a weapon. Instead of sharing belligerent memes to “fight back” the status quo or the obnoxious, intolerant people that you have come across with; be patient instead. Create a platform and a space where people can feel safe talking to you and asking questions and seeking help. Most of us have been conditioned and indoctrinated to eat meat and dairy products. Stop acting like it's not hard, stop acting like it isn’t a hardship for some to leave something that brings them so much joy. I’ve lived in several countries throughout my life and you have no idea how out of touch you can sound when you nag people who are trying to quit meat gradually instead of instantly. In third world countries, vegan alternatives are much more difficult to acquire and the building blocks for a well-balanced, tasty diet without the help of animal-based products are simply not there sometimes. People find comfort in their favorite food and to take that away from them is going to be challenging but if you want to gain more followers in your movement I implore you to leave the self-righteousness behind and learn to be resilient. Ignorant people will give you shit, so what? Prove that you are in this for the right reasons and talk to them, teach them and be patient. It takes time for people to come around and find within themselves the answers and strength to take this kind of life-changing decision.\\n\\nAll of you together need to change your radical approach. I know that animals are being tortured to an incomprehensible level, but if you want to win this generational war, you need to do it with kindness and understanding. You may think it's dumb and that people should just “grow up” and do the right thing. Well, guess what: that’s not gonna happen by guilting them. That’s why there are so many visceral attacks against you, people are in denial and have protective mechanisms, you shall strip those down one at a time. You may be thinking “Changing people is not my responsibility” and you are right, this post is written for those of you who already had taken on that responsibility, who have already talked to your friends and family, and are active on social media, and donate, and volunteer your time.\\n\\nSlow and steady wins the race. You are on the right side of history and if you know history you understand that these things are won by fighting methodically, not emotionally.\\n\\nThis is my feedback to you, I want this world to be better for the next generation and you are a big part of that, but you must change.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I\\'m not saying it\\'s all or most vegans, and I\\'m not trying to troll or start problems. I\\'m genuinely curious. Doesn\\'t harassment seem to have the opposite effect? I get you feel strongly about veganism, but wouldn\\'t it be smarter to be a bit subtle about it? In my experience, it seems to work better when it\\'s more of a suggestion than a demand. I feel like a lot of vegan hate is because of those few who take it too far and it causes people to ignore the situation entirely. Maybe having a conversation about it and subtly bringing up the conversation will get a lot more people to want to at least become vegetarian. To me \"oh yeah veganism is pretty chill. There\\'s a lot of benefits too\" sounds a lot better than \"meat-eaters are terrible people and are going to hell. become vegan or else you\\'re shitty\" ofc the latter is really just an example and i don\\'t think people say those exact words, but there are vegans who try to shove that belief down other people\\'s throats. You catch more bees with honey than with vinegar (or whatever the saying is)',\n",

       "  'selftext': '&gt;Those who are unconvinced that the harm caused by the average child  to other humans is sufficient to support the anti-natalist conclusion  will have to reckon with the immense harm that humans do to animals.  More than 63 billion terrestrial animals and, by very conservative  estimates, more than 103 billion aquatic animals are killed for human  consumption every year. The amount of death and suffering is simply staggering.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would think it wrong to breed new members of that species  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;All this is caused by the human appetite for animal flesh and  products, an appetite shared by the great majority of humans. Using very  conservative estimates, every human (who is not a vegetarian or vegan)  is, on average, responsible for the death of 27 animals per year, or  1,690 animals over the course of a lifetime.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Perhaps you think that by raising vegan children you can evade the  reach of the misanthropic argument. However, each new child, even if a  vegan, is very likely to contribute to environmental damage, one of the  means whereby humans harm humans and other animals. In the developed  world, the per-capita contribution to environmental degradation is  considerable. It is much lower in the developing world, but the much  higher birthrate there offsets the per-capita saving.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would  think it wrong to breed new members of that species. The breeding of  humans should be held to the same standard.\\n\\n[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/mhtg5u/having_children_is_not_lifeaffirming_its_immoral/) [source](https://aeon.co/essays/having-children-is-not-life-affirming-its-immoral)',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hi, like the other members of this sub I love animals and I often cry thinking of animals being killed. This feeling has caused me to buy 5 pigs in hopes of giving them a life outside of the slaughterhouse. My first 4 pigs i had to give to animal sanctuaries because I didn't have a place where the landlord was OK with them.\\n\\nMy mum often scolds me that I was wrong and irresponsible. I don't think she understands how deeply I love animals despite becoming a vegetarian after I became one aged 12. I honestly do not regret getting my first 4 pigs because the fact is they would be dead right now had I not bought them.\\n\\nRight now I have my 5th pig. I will admit to you I didn't have permission from my landlord to get a pig but I was hoping my flatmates wouldn't mind. However one minded. The pig happened to run off at which point it was taken to a stable pending the ear tag which I then ordered. I have now collected the pig and taken it to pet boarding pending moving into a rented flat with a garden in a few days.\\n\\nI am being totally honest here when I say i didn't look for housing until after having the pig, largely because I doubted any landlord would say yes but I couldn't take it any more thinking of innocent creatures dying.\\n\\nI did spend some time with the pig for 4 days before it was at the stable or pet boarding. Another thing that made me worry I'm a bad person is that I took the pig on a walk and it only walked with me half the time and it plopped down and I dragged it a bit because it was too heavy to hold. It's 3 months old but it weights almost 35 kg. I then noticed part of its skin was bleeding and I felt really bad like wow this is my fault.\\n\\nI also find myself flying by the seat of my pants because I find most online info too confusing to understand. However I have requested contact info for the farm from where the stable orders pig feed so I should be able to feed it properly going forward. This morning I fed it a whole easter cake. I felt a bit ashamed though that I googled can pigs eat dog food before taking my pig to the pet boarding.\\n\\nI guess all this has made me feel like, I do have good intentions but I sometimes think I'm some sort of idiot because of all the trouble I get into with my piglets and I wonder if something is wrong with my brain.\\n\\nI will say my pig liked me very much. It loved sitting on my lap and lying next to me. It loved spooning as well and often fell asleep next to me.\\n\\nAnyways I'm open to suggestions.\",\n",

I\\'m 35, British, male, and live in Rome, Italy. The Friday after we locked down here for covid (Friday 6th March) I idly wondered if I could manage to not eat dairy, meat or fish for a week - well, that felt good and manageable, so it became a month and now I\\'m a year in. Thought I should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it\\n\\nweight - I lost it, I\\'m about 6\\'2 and weighed around 81kg (I didn\\'t regularly weigh myself before going vegan) - summer last year I\\'d sometimes be as little as 73 kg (but I think that\\'s cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don\\'t need to eat much). I\\'ve settled at about 75kg and I\\'m still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise\\n\\nMuscle definition is better, more pronounced, I nearly have abs, waist goes in more, though I think I\\'m still using the same hole on my belt\\n\\nSkin - far better, old marks (not scars, but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin, are fading or have faded completely. Mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too. \\n\\nSkin on body is also somehow softer/ smoother - tricky one to describe\\n\\nskin on face - basically no breakouts now (fingers crossed) . I was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years, but now my skin is clear, though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose, but then we\\'ll have half term (I\\'m a teacher) and I wear masks way less and it\\'s clear that\\'s just down to the masks\\n\\nLast time, in the 6 month update I wrote about possibly being less wrinkly, dunno about that\\n\\nface is definitely leaner though, cheekbones more pronounced\\n\\nnose is less stuffy/ blocked - used to be I would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while I slept, now I don\\'t need them\\n\\nThink I\\'m sleeping better\\n\\nThink possibly, I\\'m recovering faster when I do go for a run (my main form of exercises). I haven\\'t been running regularly recently, but when I have I feel like that soreness I\\'d sometimes get in my thighs - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the name I think, is lesser than I might expect. It seems that plant-based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result - I\\'m hardly an example of this but did think I should say. About a month ago I managed to run 12k on Saturday morning and then 10 on the Sunday  - not sure I\\'ve done that much on successive days since Jan 2018 (I\\'d done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time, but ended up injuring myself). My usual run ( is 5-8 km), Wasn\\'t particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either\\n\\nMy nails are growing more quickly, I\\'m basically wolverine\\n\\npeople talk about having more energy - I don\\'t know about that, I\\'ve always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards (once was nicknamed the duracell bunny)\\n\\nPossibly TMI stuff - so feel free to avoid\\n\\nBO - dramatically reduced, to the degree that I don\\'t bother with deodorant any more (before I used to use one of those deo blocks from lush). I don\\'t work in construction or a really physical job or anything, but it does get hot obviously here in Italy, and even after i go running or whatever my tee-shirts and my armpits don\\'t smell too bad\\n\\nDigestion - I\\'ve never had a problem with constipation, always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit, but shall we say, I have even less of a problem now. Perhaps I used to make 1 or 2 \"sitting visits\" to the bathroom every day, now it\\'s more like 3 or 4 - suppose I might be spending more on toilet paper - is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive? For the first few days though, digestion was interesting, I didn\\'t have diarrhoea or anything, but ready access to a toilet was useful, luckily I was working from home - it even came out green a few times\\n\\nErections - feel like they\\'re harder, perhaps last longer and perhaps that my \"recovery time\" is less. Used to be, after I came that\\'d be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours, but lately, I reckon round 2 might be on the cards. Also, I did wonder, months back, whether I\\'d gotten slightly bigger when hard, than usual, not so that anyone else would notice, it\\'s not like I gained inches, but it felt slightly different in my hand - could just be that that\\'s because it\\'s harder, or maybe I really did gain something (in girth). This doesn\\'t really matter, it could all be in my head (I typed hand there accidentally lol) it\\'s not about to affect my relationship, the difference, if there is one, is minimal, but wanted to put it out there. Dunno if my cum tastes better, sorry. \\n\\nend of the TMI\\n\\nThink eating plant-based has helped me with a long-term injury, I got illiotibial band syndrome in Jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it, and sometimes run, while takign care to try to not to worsen it. It seems almost healed now (plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory) - trouble is I complicated it on one of my occasional runs (before going plant-based) and managed to give myself hip bursitis/ trochanteritis - though this is also getting better, and I also attribute it\\'s getting better partly to Time, the great healer, and partly to my diet. \\n\\nHonestly, I don\\'t see myself eating meat, fish or dairy again, I\\'m really happy with my diet, and as time goes on, and now I find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling. My friends and family know I\\'m vegan, and I\\'ve been encouraging them to try it, colleagues at work know and gently take the piss, but they can see that I\\'m the healthiest person there I mean, I prob was before too, so for me that makes it more compelling - I didn\\'t have too much spare weight on me as far as I was concerned, or any worrying health problems, but all these unexpected benefits happened. At the same time as safeguarding my future health, I\\'m able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly.\\n\\nSome resources I\\'ve found really helpful are Mic the vegan on youtube\\n\\nMichael Greger\\'s how not to die book, and his website nutritionfacts\\n\\nplant-based news on youtube is good too\\n\\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the long post\\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nI\\'ve been plant-based for a year and it\\'s great, I don\\'t see myself going back',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I made this list as an answer to another post here, but I'll post it again, since I think this list is interesting for everyone.\\n\\nThis list of crucial nutrients for vegans are made for europeans. Selenium for example is no problem for people who are living in places with selenium rich soils like canada or huge parts of the US. I also wrote down how I recommend getting these nutrients. \\n\\nVery Very Crucial:\\n- Vitamin B12 (supplement)\\n\\nVery Crucial:\\n- Vitamin D (not just for vegans; people who don't live in sunny areas of the World should supplement it)\\n- Iodine (also depends on your location; i recommend a supplement since the Iodine content in algae is hugely varying)\\n- DHA (seeds with high ALA contents like flax, chia or hemp, if you are worried about your conversion rate, better supplement it together if EPA)\\n\\nCrucial:\\n- zinc (legumes, pumpkin/sunflower/chiaseeds, some nuts etc.)\\n- EPA (Same as DHA, but less crucial, because ALA is converted easier into EPA than into DPA)\\n- selenium (this depends on your local soil, I recommend a supplement, because the selenium content of brazil nut are hugely varying)\\n\\nLess crucial:\\n- iron (seeds, dried apricots, oat, legumes, etc.)\\n- vitamin B2 (found in small parts in many foods, so it should add up even if you never thought about your B2 intake, very good sources are mushrooms and almonds)\\n- calcium (plant Milk with extra calcium, greens, many other vegetables, nuts, mineral water, etc.)\\n- vitamin K2 (can be converted from K1, best source is kale) \\n\\nNot really crucial, but worth mentioning:\\n- protein (legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, etc)\\n- lysine (most crucial amino acid for vegans and one of the many reasons you should eat your legumes every day, some seeds also have huge amounts)\\n- energy (you should consider eating more, since vegan foods tend to have a lower calorie density)\\n\\nAlso notice that Vitamin A is easy to get from conversation from beta carotene, but some people (I think one in 10.000, but idk the exact number) can't convert beta carotene properly, these people should consider eating more carots, sweet potatoes and pumpkins or taking a retinol supplement.\\n\\n(Main source: Niko Rittenau, german nutritionist, specialized in veganism)\",\n",

Something that really bothers me is when my omnivore friends are constantly posting videos of cute animals, like cows, turtles, pigs and others. I understand that when they are posting these videos, they are not thinking about their diet in the slightest... but it seems so hypocritical to me to share a cute video of a cow when it’s pretty likely that the cow in the video is going to be slaughtered/has already been slaughtered.

       "  'selftext': 'Just as a warning, this is going to sound crazy. I feel crazy. I’m having difficulty coping, and I need a safe place to express my thoughts. \\n\\nFor five days, I’ve been obsessively following the animals that are being left to die in the Suez Canal. The thought of the heat, the excruciating discomfort, thirst, and hunger, standing in their own feces... I’m a wreck. If an article pops up and I read it, I have the urge to smash my phone on the wall. I’m furious this is happening and that there’s nothing I can do. I can’t find a way to help, a way to donate. I know they are going to their death either way, but slaughter is less cruel than starvation and high heat. Any time I see stories like this, like when pigs were being inhumanely killed en masse during the pandemic because demand for bacon went down, or when I watch a documentary on the livestock industry, I’m a wreck. Which is a problem, because part of my job for 5 years has been to teach students about animal agriculture. I cry every day after school during that unit. I’ve been vegan for over ten years. I help run a farm sanctuary that someone else started. I can’t do anything else. I’ve sunk all my money and time into helping these animals. I left my first job because I couldn’t stomach animal testing and the dead beagles I’d pass every day in the freezer, even if I wasn’t directly involved. Knowing there were puppies who would spend their short lives in a cage being fed research chemicals right next to my lab left me suicidal.  I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t save them. I couldn’t even go in to look at them.  There’s so much unnecessary, human-inflicted suffering in the world, and I have a hard time keeping a level head about it. I know it’s not helpful. But I hate not being able to help. Sometimes I feel like if I suffer with them, if I starve, if withhold water from myself, maybe I’ll feel less worthless. But that’s mental illness. I don’t know how to cope. How do you cope? How do you watch the videos and keep up with the news? I used to slaughter pigs before I started rescuing them. I was a different person. I don’t know how I did that, and I can never forgive myself. Every day I feel like I deserve to die. I’m powerless. I’m part of the problem.  I don’t know what to do.\\n\\nPlease be kind. I’m genuinely hoping someone in this community might understand. My therapist thinks I’m overreacting. But she has no idea how bad it is. Not many people do.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Sonic, at least in the earlier games, is a pretty maintext pro-animal-liberation role model (freeing animals from enslavement in robots and capsules and stuff). Sonic is almost never violent towards other sentient beings (again, until later games that got edgier), and only destroyed machinery (as far as I remember) across the whole of the classic trilogy (I guess he fights with Knuckles in 3&amp;K, but it’s not really violent, it’s more kinda just the two butting heads. Knuckles gets back up and is fine after like 5 seconds.). Also, Sonic 3&amp;K is an anti-imperialist story (as many post-WWII Japanese stories are, for obvious cultural reasons), with Knuckles being the victim of theft of his indigenous mineral wealth (the Master Emerald). \\n\\nMario is a pawn in the conflict between the Toadstools and the Koopas. He hails to the hierarchy of feudalism, and is deeply violent, crushing sentient beings to death under his own weight, possibly scorching or freezing them alive, or causing blunt force trauma by method of a raccoon tail, shell, or other thrown object. Whether or not the “enemies” intend to harm him is irrelevant, as he can easily outmaneuver their relatively ineffective attempts to do so. And what is Mario’s goal? Not liberation of the oppressed, not a questioning of the destructive feudalist system that surrounds him, but instead a return of the Toadstool monarchy to power, for his own romantic interests. Peak bootlicking.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello there fellow vegan,\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96csy5nk1fq61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aa778ea8ba7325774f50459cd935320f98df0a6\\n\\nSo what\\'s that ? A pizza. One that is vegan and cheese free.  \\nSo what ? So begin the story of an individual who knocked down everything he knew about how the things are supposed to be.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nVeganism changed my take on pizza. When I made my first vegan pizza years ago, **I was sooooo attached to put cheese replacement**. That\\'s how it is supposed to be, that\\'s how tradition works, that\\'s how it will be. Oh god... I had hard time to swallow those industrial vegan cheese. My tummy was not happy. Years later, I now make pizza without cheese. Some people around me feel like it\\'s not \"real\" pizza, because we don\\'t have the pleasure of that melted cheese string growing as you try to tear it the higher you raise it. And I get it. It was 30 years of habits that I had to put aside. I loved every single cheese string. But pizza (sorry dear italian) can be and will from now on (for me at least) be enjoyed without cheese or any kind of replacement. It *just* requires to deconstruct what society told you pizza should be. As the song says : \"**make your own kind of pizza, topped it with your own special parts\"** or something like this. I don\\'t know 😊\\n\\n&gt;For those who don\\'t have the song reference, here it is : [https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8](https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8)\\n\\nI know. I know. \"Dude, it\\'s just a freaking pizza...\". I guess you are right. But this pizza right here is the results of years of years of social deconstruct. Not just veganism, oh no. I wish it was that simple. It catapulted me in a world I never though to discover. A world where I had to deconstruct my whole social world.\\n\\nIt\\'s a muscle. Every time I watched a documentary on veganism, that muscle activated. Doubt everything, question everything. Is this how things are supposed to be ? Why male character have more dialogue time in Disney than female one ? Are electric cars really that green ? Are we supposed to be all boy / girl ? Why should asian should be good at math and \"rice eater\" when I eat more rice than 80% of the one I know ? Should I eat this boeuf bourguignon at Christmas because we\\'ve been doing it since I was born ? Why is it that I should have a kid by now ?\\n\\nIt may be be far-fetched. I mean, the guy is writing about LGBTQIA+, about food, about relation between men and women (and all those in-between, my bad I\\'m not familiar enough yet). Well it all boiled down to that one simple thing : social deconstruct.\\n\\n30 years of having meat every meals. 30 years of drinking milk because \"they are our friends\" (french ads). 30 years of considering meat manly and vegetables an option. And so much more.\\n\\nI am thankful for veganism. Not because I live an (almost) cruelty free lifestyle, but because I had to deconstruct the world around me and ended up more humble about my life as a white guy in a developped country, and compassionate for those who must endure.\\n\\nFor a great number of people, being vegan is about the animals and the cruelty. I\\'m not completely there yet but someday I will. God I hate those ingredients list that ends with 0.01% of powedered milk. For now, it is about deconstructing everything I know about the world I was raised in.\\n\\nAnd that, dear readers, is a pizza which has been socialy deconstructed and rebuilt from scratch. Well almost, I still make them round most of the time, with tomato sauce and all but you got the idea. The best I have every week for several months now. One day I\\'ll be fully vegan, one deconstruction at a time.\\n\\nNot sure about the goal of this post, probably some make my ego blush a tinny little bit but I also hope it could serve some people to tackle way more than veganism in their path.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHave a wonderful day people ! May the vegan god shower you with lentils and kindness 🤗',\n",

And we know it's nothing good.\\n\\nBut we can do something. We can change our destiny. We can evolve. We can save our planet and save ourselves.\\n\\nGoing Vegan is the single best step that we can take in order to reach this future and reduce our carbon footprint. And if we take all the other steps, too, like switching to renewable energy and recycling, we can be sure that one day our kids will be proud of us, because we granted them a sustainable future, or better, because we granted them a future.\\n\\nFurthermore, by going Vegan we save billions (yes, you read it right, billions...) of animals from being raped, slaughtered, tortured, abused and killed. There's absolutetly no reason that can justify all of this. It's wrong. It's stupid. It's dangerous. It's evil. It must be stopped.\\n\\nLast, but not least, Veganism can help humans right now, not only the future ones. Think of all the people who work in slaughterhouses. The majority of them suffers from PTSD, and will probably suffer from it for the rest of their life.\\n\\nThis is why Veganism is the next step in human evolution.

The don't really dig deeper to question morality and speciesism. The two documentaries that present the strongest ethical cases are the two that Netflix does not offer. It's good that Netflix has a few plant based diet documentaries, but I really hope they open their catalog to more bitter truths. I'm going to be watching Seaspiracy this week, but judging from the trailer I can tell it's not really about the animals, its about the pollution and industry agendas as a whole. Which is fine, but that really is only the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully I am wrong about this assumption and it really does create a voice for the animals that are suffering and being slaughtered.\\n\\nNetflix plays a major role in a lot of people's worldly education, just because of their extensive list of easily accessible documentaries.

       "  'selftext': '(i posted this to the cosmic skeptic (youtube dude and vegan) reddit about a week ago and then just found this sub. Being the upvote whore that i am, i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared :p)\\n\\nThis post ended up being really long and rambling, so im adding this at the start. TL;DR i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of Alex\\'s arguments for veganism, and the documentary \"land of hope and glory\" by Earthling Ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making.\\n\\nI dont know if he reads anything on this sub, but if by any chance Alex sees this, then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point.\\n\\nIve been watching for a while, mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years, and honestly, when he first started doing veganism related content, i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention. But something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully, and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument (at least for someone in my position) for consuming animal products in the way i did. I resisted at first, mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of \"well, im such a small cog in the machine, what im doing makes no REAL difference\"...But i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat. This lasted, i think, several months.\\n\\nThen roughly a week or so ago, i sat down (with a pork sausage sandwich) and started browsing youtube videos, and i come across podcast #9 with Earthling Ed ([https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04](https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04)). I watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as (what i now recognize to be...) my cognitive dissonance starts to break down. Partway through the video Earthling Ed\\'s documentary \"land of hope and glory\" was mentioned (i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview - link to the documentary &gt; [https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)) and i was curious, so i paused that video and googled it, and started watching. The pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point.\\n\\nAs much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this, i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life. I had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals, about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut, or how pigs were put into gas chambers. But i had never actually been confronted with it. Never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death. Or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture-porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death. And as silly as it sounds, i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch, but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal. And i simply could not finish that sandwich, i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point, but i just couldn\\'t stomach it.\\n\\nAnd from there, the floodgates had opened, i realized that if i couldn\\'t eat meat anymore, then milk and cheese were off the table too, since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons. Fish i found were more difficult to empathize with, and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish, until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was. \"can fish really feel pain? i swear i read they couldnt...\" a quick google informed me that, yes, fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain, duhhhhh. And of course i realized that ive always found the Japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic, so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones?\\n\\nIve not been vegan long now, as i said, about a week. But honestly, what has surprised me most is this...ITS SO EASY. I had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous \"taste martyr\" to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life... and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised, if i didnt know better, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS MEAT. Alternative cheese, butter, milk, chicken, sausages etc... it all tastes really good?! What the hell?! Why isnt this better known?! As for health, my diet has been quickly improving, im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar (im far too addicted to fizzy drinks) But im eating far more leafy greens, veg and fruit, and im really enjoying it!\\n\\nThe only problem im having now is trying not to be the \"preachy vegan\" to my family. I dont know whats right at this point, to live and let live, or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me. I almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused.\\n\\nThis was wayyyy longer than i meant to make it and if you made it this far, thankyou for listening to my rambling.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"In Frederick Douglass's autobiography *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave*, a common theme is that Douglass believes the institution of slavery was not only abhorrent for the slaves themselves, but also polluted the hearts and lives of the white owners. He wrote the following about a Master Hugh:\\n\\n&gt;My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. \\n\\n*Douglass 43*\\n\\nHe later states;\\n\\n&gt;. . . for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; . . .  \\n\\n*Douglass 52*\\n\\nHave any of you seen or experienced similar parallels? I'm not looking for health benefits, rather a greater character and psyche from rejecting animal cruelty. Thanks!\",\n",

Why does this subreddit seem so hostile? From the posts I've read I expect to be called names and down voted for my curiosity.

It's like those horror stories where the protagonist came out of a trance induced by some Lovecraftian menace, and realize that everyone else is still in that trance, and are being controlled to slaughter and torture for pleasure. You desperately cry unto them, pleading, begging for everyone to wake up, to recognize what's happening, only to be met by zombie-like, reactionary out-lash.\\n\\nWhen you truly understand what the animal products industry is doing, outrage, frustration and despair are **the most natural** response. Of course in activism the tone and language must be carefully managed as to not provoke a reaction from the public, but after becoming a vegan I absolutely get why people in the movement have this emotional outcry for others to change.\",\n",

I still don\\'t mind eating meat, but I prefer not to when I have the option.\\n\\nI did have a genuine question though. If you raised your own chickens just for fun, would you eat their eggs? I ask because I used to raise poultry (not for meat purposes), and they were always producing eggs. The hens, if no rooster was present, would rarely be broody (they were rarely broody even with a rooster), so the eggs were just left in the nest. I understand going vegan out of concern for animals and their treatment, but in this case, no animal is being harmed and it keeps animals like snakes and raccoons out of your coop because they know there are no eggs. Is there anything that makes eating these eggs unethical in your eyes, or would it be okay because you own these chickens and they\\'re free-range - not being forced to live in terrible conditions to maximize production?\\n\\nI\\'m just genuinely curious! I choose vegan options at the store when possible (if I have the budget for it since it can get expensive), but I spent the majority of my childhood raising chickens and just couldn\\'t get this question out of my head. **I do understand not wanting to buy eggs in the store because of the horrible conditions they keep chickens in.** \\n\\n(I would also just genuinely like to know what made you choose to go vegan, questions aside! Did you start out vegetarian first, or did you hop right in?)\\n\\nI hope none of my questions offend and thank you for taking the time to read this!

       "  'selftext': 'While the 100 billion land animals + 3.5 trillion fish murdered every year by humans is of course the primary concern, as it should be. We should focus on alleviating the suffering of the animals that are slaughtered entirely needlessly and gratuitously before all else, and I’m not trying to take away from that. \\n\\nI still think the suffering of wild animals is something that ought to be taken into account, if not now, then in the future. \\n\\nElephants have only one set of teeth. In the wild, elephants who grow too old die of starvation, because their teeth have worn out. This does not happen in captivity, because they are given special attention, and are allowed to peacefully die of old age. \\nDon’t all elephants deserve this fate? I would certainly argue there is not a single elephant that deserves to starve to death, yet this happens quite regularly. \\n\\nThere are a lot of arguments against humans alleviating animal suffering, but I think only one works: we do not yet have the technology to prevent wild animal suffering on a large scale without doing tremendous harm to the environment. However, I do not believe this will always be the case, and I think every other argument made against it is extremely unconvincing. \\n\\n1) Argument: This is anthropomorphic, because “good” and “bad” are human terms\\n\\nRefutation: An elephant dying of starvation in a field of grass is bad. If you disagree with this point then I’m not sure anything can be done to convince you otherwise. \\n\\n2) Argument: Humans should not interfere with nature. This is arrogance. \\n\\nRefutation: Humans interfere with nature ALL THE TIME. We’re currently causing the biggest mass extinction in 65 million years. Every time we take medication, we are “interfering with nature”. Every time we chop down a tree we are “interfering with nature”. When we do something awful, something that’s catastrophic on a global scale, cruelty-apologists look the other way, but when we suggest doing something that prevents suffering in animals they’re all “oh let’s not interfere with nature!” Give me a break. \\n\\nWild animals who have undergone predator attacks suffer from PTSD. Nature is generally a terrible place, thriving on suffering. Granted, places like slaughterhouses are infinitely worse, as they’re designed to cause permanent suffering, but we shouldn’t let bad things happen ONLY because there are worse things going on.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I know I\\'ll probably get a lot of hate for this, but it\\'s something I need to get off my chest and am genuinely interested if people are willing to have an adult conversation about this.\\n\\nAs a vegan and animal lover, I also... don\\'t hate zoos. I follow a lot of vegan pages on instagram, watch vegan youtubers and over and over I see nothing but hate for zoos. Saying they should all be closed, and that everyone who visits one should be cancelled etc. Usually attached to some old photos from third world country zoos with animals living in horrible conditions. \\n\\nMy belief is that in an ideal world, zoo\\'s wouldn\\'t exist and every animal would live freely in it\\'s natural habitat. But sadly, we don\\'t live in an ideal world, we live in a world filled with pollution, habitat destruction, hunting, mass scale farming, over-fishing destroying the oceans. And in this world zoo\\'s sadly are vital for the care of wild animals. \\n\\nI work in this industry, and see it all from the inside, so I find it upsetting when some vegans are so quick to judge and so short-sighted on zoos. I work in a small town wildlife sanctuary. At this sanctuary yes, we do have animals on display that are captive animals and can\\'t be released to the wild. And yes we charge people tickets to enter because that\\'s the only funding we get. But behind the scenes we have a hospital where we rescue, rehab and release wild animals. Hundreds per year, who never see the public and have limited contact with humans. \\n\\nAnd what do we do when we get a case we can\\'t handle? We take it to the zoo. We are a small establishment with limited facilities, but we have a good relationship with the local zoo which has an amazing big animal hospital.\\n\\nWe get everything from pelicans with fishing wire down their throats to wombats who have been hit by a car. But one thing is consistent to almost all of our rescues, and that is that they are needing to be rescued because of interference from humans in one way or another. We caused the problem, so we feel the need to help fix it. Also, my sanctuary is almost entirely volunteer run. We work long hours, mostly outdoors in all sorts of weather for zero pay, just because we are passionate about helping animals. \\n\\nI also recently visited another much larger wildlife sanctuary in a different state, which had about 200-300 animals on display, but in 2020 alone they rescued, rehabed then released 14,000 wild animals. Just in one year! And the truth about this is that no one else can really do this but zoos. People take injured native wildlife to vets, but vets rarely know how to treat animals outside of cats and dogs, and they usually just sit in a cage until they can be transferred to a zoo or specialised wildlife carer. \\n\\nBetween breeding programs of endangered animals, to all the rescue work with zoo hospitals, to the extensive conservation work done worldwide to help ensure the future of wildlife etc zoos are now vital to our world if you like animals. I see this all from inside the industry so it\\'s kind of frustrating to see vegans pointing to things like Tiger King or third world zoos\\' or other horrible, abusive attractions and using those to say all zoos are evil and should be closed. If all zoo\\'s closed overnight it would be devastating for the world\\'s wild animals. It\\'s the sad truth. Zoo\\'s aren\\'t all made equal. Worldwide yes, there are some horrific, sad, abusive zoo\\'s and wildlife \"Attractions\" that I wish would close as much as anyone, but that shouldn\\'t diminish the good amazing zoos and the people who work at them. \\n\\nTLDR: I wish vegans would actually research what goes on at Zoos before judging them all so harshly, or judging them all by the worst examples of zoos on the planet.',\n",

After we got off the boat and took a stroll around the dock, I saw some men \"scaling\" fish with the back of a knife. It was a violent scraping, and scales were flying in the air. But the fish were still alive during the process, they were wildly flopping around on the workbench as the men tried to hold them down. As a little kid seeing this, I was utterly distraught and it literally traumatized me to some degree. The memory and the sheer callousness of it is still etched into my mind. \\n\\nA few years later when I was around 8, my mom had gone grocery shopping and prepared a dinner for the family. When she called me to the table, there was a rack of lamb sitting on a platter. Seeing the little ribcage on our table like that, is when the connection between the animal and my food suddenly became really salient. It wasn\\'t food, it was part of a corpse. I remember being horrified, protesting to my parents about it, storming to my room crying. I knew how precious lambs were and would have done anything to protect them. Since then I had an aversion to any type of meat with visible bones in it. \\n\\n(Sidenote: My grandpa had a flock of sheep, and in the springtime I\\'d get to go and play with the lambs. Years later I would find out that he\\'d always choose the \"juiciest\" one to be butchered. And then we\\'d eat its flesh during Christmas dinners and other holidays. None of my family bothered to tell me where the meat came from.)\\n\\nThere are countless more examples. As a kid I saw animals frantically pacing back and forth in tiny zoo enclosures, watched lobsters get chucked into boiling pots of water, etc. I\\'ve always found it absolutely horrendous, yet I still didn\\'t go vegan until I was 17. Perhaps most children are vegans at heart, but succumb to the pressure of conforming to social norms as they grow older. Especially being told the \"happy cows\" spiel and all that.

       "  'selftext': 'First of all, I wanna apologize for my bad english, I\\'m not a native speaker, but I want to share my story and hear about yours.\\n\\nWhen I was young I thought vegans were crazy and I remember joking around with my brother about those protein-deficient and opinion-forcing plant eaters. I knew about the facts of the inhumane circumstances of lifestock farming and the outrageous consequences for our enviroment, but never reflected on them.\\n\\nThis all changed when I was 13 in early 2016, I was eating my favourite dish - spaghetti bolognese - when I scrolled through the trending YouTube videos and a video called \"Fleischkonsum zerstört unseren Planeten\" (meat consumption destroys our planet) by the german vegan \"influencer\" Luna Darko came into my sight, she would influence me pretty much in the following year on what person I want to be in the future, she seemed pretty smart and empathic, and often talked about self-love, self discovery, feminism etc. (sadly she deleted this video and distanced herself from the label \\'vegan\\' last year). At this time I was very open and interested in enviromental topics, so I clicked on this video, I remember listening to what she had to say, she sounded very calm, polite and friendly, but you could also tell that this was a very important topic to her, she talked mostly about the eniviroment, but also about the connections to starvation, deseases and health issues and ethics, I remember when she said \"I know this might be the least convincing point for most people, which I think is very sad, cause we should care about this, but a pig has the same cognitive capability as a 3 year old human\", but for me it was one of the most convincing points, beside those about the complex social structures and emotions of cows and chickens. In the following days I gave frequent thoughts on this matter and decided that I want to be vegan myself someday - but not now. My father cooked much meat at this time and I don\\'t wanted the social stigma of a male vegan.\\n\\nFor some reason I didn\\'t even made a first step in the following years, but I knew that becoming vegan was the only right thing to do. I informed myself further on this topic and often argued in favor of veganism, but when a dairy or meat product was on my plate I forgot about it. I devoloped a hobby in cooking in 2017 and became the chef of what I eat, I reduced my flesh consumption, but still ate much of it.\\n\\nThis changed in March 2020 when my school stopped because of a global zoonotic pandemic and I decided to make the first step and got veggie. I knew that this wasn\\'t enough and that I still wanted to be vegan someday, but I loved cheese, which of course I knew isn\\'t a proper reason to eat it, but nevertheless I still ate it. My father, with whom I live with, was very supportive, beside often making stupid jokes and statements.\\n\\nI became very interested in health topics, and started practising and eating more vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. I read many books and articles and nearly became obsessed with nutrition, so I discovered Niko Rittenau (german vegan nutritionist) and Dr. Michael Greger and read their books \"Vegan-Klischee ade\" (maybe the best book on nutrition, critical nutrients and debunking nutrition based stereotypes about veganism, sadly it\\'s only available in german) and \"How not to die\", which had many shocking facts in it. So I decided to finally go vegan on my 1st anniversary of becoming vegetarian.\\n\\nIt\\'s been one week and it\\'s a miracle - There were 2/3 days in which I craved for cheese, but now, I don\\'t even miss it anymore, despite our fridge being full of it. I am very happy that I\\'m finally vegan and regret that I haven\\'t done it sooner.\\n\\nBut now I\\'m excited to hear about how your first seed was planted.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This post is a bit odd for this subreddit, but I think it’s sufficiently on-topic. First, my brief background is that I’ve been a musician for about 20 years and I’ve been *mostly* vegan for about 2 months. Lifestyle changes take work and time, so please forgive me for the “mostly” qualifier. I’m sure you all understand. 🙂\\n\\nAnyhow, I immediately (within a day or two) started noticing measurable and subjective improvements in my health. My resting heart rate has lowered from 72 to 56 on average - holy smokes! My wedding ring is also looser. And that brings me to the subjective part. \\n\\nIt’s fairly well known that a plant based diet lowers inflammation throughout the entire body as compared to a, for lack of a better term, “typical American diet.” But what I didn’t expect was that this would directly transfer to my ability to play my instrument. \\n\\nI’m a percussionist, which is basically a pompous high-brow term for drummer (badum-tschhh). When it comes to almost any instrument, a lot boils down to your technique, which determines your energy output and physical stress on soft tissue and joints. Well, in my case, my muscles have been able to fly through music and exercises as if I were 10 years younger, which was actually my peak physical condition. I get less tired, I’m less sore, and I recover much faster. My muscles aren’t are swollen after intense playing and I’m ready to go in less than half the recovery time. \\n\\nIt’s insane. \\n\\nI wanted to share this because it has boosted my mood beyond anything I ever expected. I’m finally jazzed (😏) about drumming again after a 2 year hiatus due to various reasons. I didn’t think an unrelated lifestyle change would make such a huge impact, but it really did. \\n\\nAlso related, my wife is also a musician (flutist) and she has reported a similar experience. \\n\\nI’ve been skeptical my whole life about vegan/plant-based diet/lifestyle. I really wish I tried this sooner. I just feel so much better overall. A boost toward getting back into my passion is seriously heart warming, too.',\n",

Sylvester Graham, the inventor of Graham crackers, co-founded the American Vegetarian Society. Graham was a Presbyterian minister and his followers, called Grahamites, obeyed his instructions for a virtuous life: vegetarianism, temperance, abstinence, and frequent bathing. In November 1944, a British woodworker named Donald Watson announced that because vegetarians ate dairy and eggs, he was going to create a new term called “vegan,” to describe people who did not. Tuberculosis had been found in 40% of Britain’s dairy cows the year before, and Watson used this to his advantage, claiming that it proved the vegan lifestyle protected people from tainted food. Three months after coining the term, he issued a formal explanation of the way the word should be pronounced: “Veegan, not Veejan,” he wrote in his new [Vegan Society](http://www.vegansociety.com/home.php) newsletter, which had 25 subscribers. By the time Watson died at age 95 in 2005, there were 250,000 self-identifying vegans in Britain and 2 million in the U.S.\"',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I finally took the plunge in February this year (ironic since the whole 'FebruDAIRY' thing). I'm honestly so content with my decision, no more feeling guilty after meals and cringing at chicken carcasses every Sunday. I grew up being extremely fussy and pretty much only eating animal products, I would heave trying to eat vegetables. I knew that I wanted to be vegan, and I knew that I wanted to be healthy, so I ate more vegetables. It was shit at first, but I found ones I liked, and I got to the point where I could make nutritious and delicious vegan meals. I realised that I didn't need animals as a dietary crutch anymore. I know it hasn't been long but honestly, it's been so amazing for both my physical and mental health. I keep having moments where I think to myself 'fuck yeah I'm vegan now.' I come from a family of foodies and I was always the odd one out eating plain chicken and rice, and now I feel like a true foodie along with them. I'm more aligned with my morals, I feel like I am closer to being a true environmentalist now. \\n\\nBut how do I talk about this to non-vegans? I only have one vegan friend, and since being switching I have noticed a very strange vibe. I haven't been met with all of the 'how do you get your protein?' nonsense just yet. I've had a bit of banter thrown at me for being awkward to buy for and having 'vegan rage' (I had a brief rant about UK tax-subsidies to a work colleague). I haven't been met with animosity, but there is this strange awkwardness.  It's almost as if people avoid the topic altogether. I genuinely thought that people would want to talk about it more, but despite a rise in popularity, I've realised that veganism is still strangely taboo. \\n\\nI don't want to be the one to sit at the dinner table talking about cow pus and chicken menstruate. I always wanted to be the 'lead by example' type, as that's how I became vegan, seeing others live happily and healthily doing so. I just didn't realise how profound this change would be for me, and I want to talk about it without feeling like I'm making things awkward. I dunno, I'm sure many of you would say that it's important to have awkward conversations for progress to happen, and I agree with you. I just don't know how to get the party started.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; I'm a new vegan, loving life. But I'm scared to spread the good word because people still seem freaked out by veganism.\",\n",

But my curiosity relates to the relationship between animals and money on the basis of Food and Clothing. \\n\\n\\nFood: So when the world has stopped eating meat, what happens to all the pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, etc? Are they just slaughtered by the millions as factory-farm owners see they're no longer profitable? Is there at all talk of reintroducing cattle to the plains and just letting them roam free? Don't these species, after so many generations of domestication and purposeful breeding, now rely on captivity? Are there any plans to monetize the small-scale domestication of animals for purpose other than meat? What are they?\\n\\n\\nClothing pertaining to sheep, alpaca, etc.:\\nWhere do we draw the line on clothing? As far as I know, there's a lot of overlap between vegan and anti climate-change/pollution communities. Wool has special properties like maintaining heat retention properties even when wet. In an ever-trying climate with harsher extremes, we may need this more than ever. Do we keep using sheep for their wool? Alpacas? The replacements are often plastic-based and I don't know which is worse.\\n\\n\\nSimilar arguments often arise concerning climate change—when we can make money at it is when it will be taken seriously, or something along those lines. Countless animals are displaced due to construction, pollution, and more. And there's currently no good way to make money out of helping these animals (Overgeneralization, and please correct me in DMs if that's wrong, but please hear me out). We primarily use nonprofits for that, right? Is there yet a way to make money helping these animals we can advertise? Something I've missed? You can keep your business ideas! I'll work for friggin' minimal wage to save the animals and the world!\\n\\nAny sources, discussion, advice, comments, or anything is welcome below!

This is due to me disagreeing with a fundamental core to veganism, namely the reduction of animal suffering by any practical means. I do not view animal exploitation as inherently evil, I believe it must depend on the circumstances. Almost all forms of animal agriculture today are cruel and I accept that.. leading me to adjust my lifestyle to avoid as much contribution to the industry as I can. However, my disagreements lie in the fact that science is leading to more and more ways where we can use animal products in sustainabe, economical, and less cruel ways.\\n\\nI will use the popular example of lab-grown meat; we are moving past the need for FBS, and the methods are getting more and more productive. I read in an article, the projection is we can create 20,000 pounds of beef from a cell collection. The implications of this are monumental, we could get to the point where we only need a small donor herd per region, the small size of this population will imensly reduce greenhouse gasses and will be easier to maintain these animals and provide them with an optimum quality of life; the only downside is being a relatively painless biopsy.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI suppose the crux of what I'm saying is that I think the exploitation of animal products can be done in an ethical way if certain parameters are met. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis leads me to my question; is this dissertation at odds with veganism?\\n\\n I greatly welcome criticism, comments, or questions.\",\n",

I can understand how overwhelming it can be sometimes to be vegan, as I was strict vegan for 3 years, emotionally it can take a toll on you and cause a lot of anxiety. How can I break it to her that this is just the diet that is working for me at the moment, without making her uncomfortable, but not having to alter my lifestyle to please her? She's a very placid person and so understanding, I am just terrified of it affecting our relationship, as I value it a lot. Your advice would be much appreciated!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey guys!  I want to share how my lifestyle changed going vegan and how it gave me a new perspective about what we're eating and the overall picture with the current food chain. \\n\\nI also want to know what you're going to think about my perspective since I have in some ways different views for which I will get maybe downvoted but just hear me out. \\n\\nWhen I started college I started living on my own which meant that I had to cook for myself which I never did before moving out. I wanted to start experimenting a little with what I eat and my friend told me he was a Netflix documentary The Game Changers which I decided to give a try and try to avoid animal and dairy products on my plate. It started slowly but I stopped buying meat, then slowly getting rid of eggs, cheese, switched to plant-based milk. \\n\\nWith this change, my teenage acne is 98% gone which was bad when I was in high school. Energy levels really boosted, I don't feel heavy when I finish my meal even if I fill myself completely, discovered so many ways of cooking and recipes.\\n\\nAfter seeing this change I was reading more about how animal agriculture works and it was such an eye-opener how messed up the whole industry works and how I was uneducated about where does the food come from, what does it contain, how much nutrition it has, what's good and what's not, how many animals are killed. \\n\\nComing from an Eastern Europe where meat is basically on a plate every second day it was quite a change, my family is still in confusion why the 'drastic' change but I won't be coming back to the eating habits because with the information I gained. \\n\\nLiving in ignorance or unawareness about how my actions impact animals, the planet was, on one hand, blissful, because let's face it, everybody loves cheese, meat but it's not right at the expense of others, not in this era when we have so many substitutes and options to choose from and with the climate crisis.\\n\\nBut here's my second thought about it: if the animal industry and dairy industry operated in a more sustainable, moral way, I would support it. \\n\\nI grow up in a village my grandma had her own chickens whose eggs were incomparable with the ones available in supermarkets.  We also got a homemade cheese from one of her friends who got their own cows.\\n\\nMy belief is that if dairy, animal products were consumed once a month or just on special occasions and didn't take it for granted, we could reduce the suffering, global warming in a great way.\\n\\nRight now in college, I am fully vegan, I read carefully what's on the label of the products I buy making sure no animal ingredients are in them.\\n\\nHowever, when I come home for a few weeks I have to cheat because I am not the one cooking and my family always puts some milk, dairy into the food but I won't touch any meat they prepare. I can see that I made some positive impact on my family and friends as well, they started eating oats in the morning, tofu, soya chunks but they are not willing to transform their eating habits completely.\\n\\nIf you read this all the way through, let me know your thoughts, please!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'As someone who has been deeply involved in veganism, although primarily for animal welfare, but morenow for environmental sustainability and humanitarian reason, I think it is workt acknowledging how biased tiktok is against vegans. Now not to say that veganism as an ideology is not worth criticism, but I keep getting videos recommended popping up in my FY page that play semantic games about veganism. Imagine if I said for example, \"everyone should donate to charity\" one would naturally assume that I am not including homeless and low income people. To assume or argue that this was the implication would clearly be a disingenuous assumption. But these are the same equivalence made about veganism on tiktok.\\n\\nPeople are constantly implying that veganism is somehow colonialism. Trying to argue from a perspective of race that vegans are trying to use Imperialist ideologies to domineer oppressed cultures. Which I know that getting sustainable food is important and trying to buy food which was acquired using laborers who aren\\'t abused financially is of course important to vegans. Most of us are deeply concerned not only about animal rights, but about human rights as well. Veganism as an ideology is altruistic in its essence. It really boggles me how people can argue that all we eat are quinoa and avocados, something that is very clearly exaggerated to seem as though we enjoy exploiting those in developing nations and their labour, but then ignore how their diet does the same. Most of the crops imported to and grown in the western world are used for the sake of the animal agricultural industry. This exploits the labour of the workers. Carnists use these arguments as if they themselves don\\'t also consume the same products we do.\\n\\nWhat angers me even more is they argue for example, that veganism is somehow racist to indigenous people and then ignore the destruction of the Amazon for animal agriculture, which is home to hundreds of indigenous tribes. Or how about the fishing industry which has fought tooth and nail, especially in Canada against the fishing rights of indigenous people, which in turn causes food insecurity? Not a peep. But they use their politics to try and instill an ideology that is based in false equivalencies. \\n\\nWanna talk about discriminating towards people of low income? How about chicken farmers in the states who live at or below the poverty line because of industry abuses? Or maybe we should see low income communities like those in North Carolina who are predominantly Black, Native American and Latinos who live near CAFOs and are dying of diseases such as cancer caused by pollution from animal waste? Or how about the fact that the last 10 global pandemics have been caused by the animal food industry, which have disproportionate health outcomes for the people in the most empoverished communities? Or how about the fact that most of the world\\'s lowest paying jobs are those of fast food workers? How about the fact that the animal agricultural industry is one one the highest sources of green house gas emissions in global warming which will harm the world most vulnerable communities as the global temperatures continue to rise? Anyone wanna mention any of that? Yet somehow veganism is exploitative and classist?\\n\\nThe fact alone that we have enough food on the planet to end world hunger, yet most of the world\\'s crops go are used to feed livestock which go to feed the world richest nations is horrifying. This is somehow a reality we\\'re all accustomed to and have collectively decided is ok. Somehow veganism is the problem.\\n\\nNow as I mentioned earlier, problems in vegan food sourcing like any other diet are worth dicussing. Like migrant workers yielding crops at what is essentially slave labour is horrifying. But this is not an issue caused by veganism, nor will it be solved by attacking veganism. If there were no vegans, this would still be an issue as news flash, carnists also eat vegetables.\\n\\nI am sick of the semantic games and I am sick of the accusations. Why are these issues only raised when the subject of veganism is brought up... I don\\'t see these carnists advocating against exploitation until it suits their biases. Can we all agree that it is getting ridiculous?\\n\\nSorry this was so long but omfg🤦\\u200d♀️',\n",

I personally keep the recipe cards in a binder so that I can make the ones I liked again. There are companies that offer vegan options and also one company (Purple Carrot) that is entirely vegan. \\n\\nThe only downside is price tag - $7-10 per portion is quite a bit, so it's definitely a luxury for me and I don't order every week. \\n\\nHas anyone else tried these, or have similar ways to try out new vegan dishes that don't involve a separate trip to the grocery store and tons of leftover ingredients? I would love to do it more, but it's time consuming, and spending $10 for a particular spice that I'm never going to use for anything else again is a bit steep.\",\n",

When we're making pancakes together she makes hers vegan and she's like oh I almost forgot you're not vegan and you prefer it with eggs and she makes mine with eggs.\\n\\nSo I'm not kidding the most respectful vegan I have ever met.

And I was like oh my gosh you know what I think the tea would probably taste really good with almond milk instead of my dairy milk. I should definitely use almond milk, because it's also really good in and I listed a few other recipes that I use it in although I don't like drinking almond milk or using it in cereal.\\n\\nThen suddenly I realized, and I called her on it, I'm like you are sneakily making me vegan!

I stopped using it for a while, but I recently found out that not only does it not spike your blood glucose, it can actually make your blood glucose [go down](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/mtic7m/eating_fruits_with_allulose/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Here's an excerpt from the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psicose):\\n\\n&gt;Allulose is a weak inhibitor of the enzymes α-glucosidase, α-amylase, maltase, and sucrase.\\\\[2\\\\] Because of this, it can inhibit the metabolism of starch and disaccharides into monosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tract.\\\\[2\\\\] Additionally, allulose inhibits the absorption of glucose via transporters in the intestines.\\\\[2\\\\] For these reasons, allulose has potential antihyperglycemic effects, and has been found to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia in humans.\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\[9\\\\]\\n\\nNo only does it block metabolism of carbs, it can lower cholesterol (if you care about such trivialities, that is):\\n\\n&gt;Through modulation of lipogenic enzymes in the liver, allulose may also have antihyperlipidemic effects.\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\[9\\\\]\\n\\nThe 2nd link above cites a bunch of studies of the antihyperglycemic effects of allulose, but there's another study that shows that it can protect the [beta cells](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230644405_Rare_sugar_D-psicose_protects_pancreas_b-islets_and_thus_improves_insulin_resistance_in_OLETF_rats) in the pancreas as well.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I formerly weighed 435 lbs and I lost 125 eating ketogenically for two years. I felt great, I was motivated in all aspects of life, but I did it for the wrong reasons. I did it because I hated myself. The day I started keto I remember the conversation I had with myself. I was severely depressed, I was ready to take drastic action in the worst way. I decided to try one last thing I would cut out everything I thought I loved - friends, Taco Bell, video games. I thought the only way to get myself to move forward was to torture myself. And I did it for two years. The results were amazing and I felt the best I ever felt but I also had the lingering sense of despair and self loathing. I gained all the weight back over the next two years and then some. I gave up on myself, I didn’t see the value of me being around. I was living in filth, I smelt bad, my hair was stupid long. I was a total embarrassment only bringing myself together to go work and even then minimal effort. \\n\\nI’m back. Two weeks ago I decided to go back to keto for me. Because I want better, because I want to be around. I want to not be embarrassed of myself when I walk into a room, or down a street or looking in the mirror. I want to not worry about having a heart attack and dying leaving behind loved ones. Some of the people I hold dearest to my heart try to convince me to get the surgery. But I already learned the hard way that it isn’t just the weight and that it was the mentality I’ve lived with for the last 15 years. I need to break that mentality and the only way for me to do it is to work through it with the right mindset. \\n\\nI’m starting at what I would guess is 475 lbs. I know I already lost weight but I don’t have a scale that can weigh me. I don’t know if anyone cares or if anyone can relate to this but I needed to get this off of my chest. Thanks everyone. Good luck out there.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Further fat loss possible on keto? (in menopause) Can you actually stall at 350#??',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'What is truly possible with keto, are there limits?\\n\\nBackstory: back in 2007, I lost 170# on keto, and then a birth-defect heart-valve failure nearly killed me. Many years later (some years bedridden on hospice dying, so full-body atrophy, low-oxygen, and major weight gain), I got surgery to fix that, eventually learned to walk again (that look like a year on my own with it), and so on. It\\'s been a few years since, and I am still not strong like I\\'d like to be though I\\'m improving. I dropped from mid-500s at surgery to around 350 (sometimes lower, I add/remove about 25-30# for water with keto, and the diuretics I must take to compensate for the heart valve still creating some edema daily) (managing mineral balance with both keto and diuretics is seriously a bitch).\\n\\nI\\'ve turned my whole living room into a home gym. When keto, I eat mostly meat, most the veggies I eat are peppers/alliums or \\'in context\\' of the meat (e.g. chili con carne). I\\'ve dropped cheese quantity radically to reduce both calories and possible inflammation. \\n\\nI am so damn stalled. If I eat carbs I gain water; if I eat ketogenically (which I have done for many years so am very fluent with it by now of course) I lose that water. I don\\'t really gain weight (because I am not off keto long enough, mostly). I don\\'t really lose weight (it drops the water, then just... doesn\\'t fuckin move! It\\'s driving me crazy).\\n\\nI have been going back and forth, about 8 weeks of keto and then about 1-2 weeks of carbs, or sometimes a fast, because it USED to be, that sometimes if weight wasn\\'t coming off, \"changing things up\" -- fasting, or actually adding carbs briefly -- would seem to resolve that. That doesn\\'t seem to be working anymore. I don\\'t think it\\'s a low thyroid issue, although I don\\'t trust doctors about this anyway it\\'s such a nightmare watching my friends try to get decent help with that, and I have no money for a doc right now anyway. Actually I have vastly more energy than I used to -- greatly thanks to supplements (thyroid support herbs, tiny bit DHEA, 7-keto metabolites, pregnenolone, CoQ10, and a variety of other things, I\\'m a supplement freak and because of the diuretics I lose some of everything all the time so I try to compensate). \\n\\nSo I don\\'t feel like it\\'s just, \"Hey you\\'re in menopause, you probably are hypothyroid or something, give up.\" I weight 350 fuckin pounds I don\\'t want to give up! I have worked so hard to get over 200# down, hell even to learn to walk again, I do NOT want to give up. But just doing the same thing to no effect at all is really screwing with my psychology.\\n\\nEating keto, even with what I think should be reasonably low calories: no weight loss. I do IF at 20/4, keto, no weight loss. I fast for 3 days, 7 days, 10 days -- yes there IS weight loss during the fast (sometimes as much as 1/2# per day max) but the instant I resume eating (lowcarb) it returns -- so, clearly it was only water weight. How is this even possible? How could I be so large, and have done so well at losing so much weight already, and yet not lose even when both calories and carbs seem like they ought to do it, especially at my still-high weight? Age 55, female, menopause (yes I know that\\'s not ideal), 5\\'6\".\\n\\nI have not yet seriously started working out. I would like to. I have... everything. I spent basically all my money on this stuff hoping to save myself. Squat cage, bench, t-bar, kettlebells, barbell, dumbbells, cables, straps... I have no idea what the hell I am doing and I do not currently have the option of hiring someone to train me (a/ unexpected poverty onset, hopefully temporary, and b/ tiny nowhere-town in nowhere-usa). I have begun walking in the mornings, I was doing that until winter, the weather only just got sane for it to start up again. So whatever the reason for my stupid stall, it can\\'t be that I\\'m working out too hard.\\n\\nSo after all that intro, I have two questions for this awesome group:\\n\\n1. Do you have any suggestions for what kind of exercise might be best to start with for someone who is not strong (bodyweight ground exercises with little muscle and high weight, esp. as a woman, are not too workable; but I can do \\'a little\\' with most of everything I have. Just not sure if I should be working on the arnold press or t-bar squats or 2-handed kettlebell or what...\\n2. Do you have any suggestions, and bear in mind I am limited to walmart food here (sigh), and that doesn\\'t involve long fasts (which I LOVE doing, but my body tells me she would prefer I not get carried away with that, as I\\'ve a long history of medical-anorexia and severe malnourishment even while huge as a result), that someone has reason to think might work to force me out of what seems an endless stall? (Like 1 year, though I have been \"In and out\" of keto all during that, my weight always returns to center at 350 like it\\'s a set-point)?\\n3. The only thing I will note is that if I do not eat at least 90g of protein a day I am less functional. Many years of trial went into knowing this about myself. Everything else can vary but that\\'s got to be a minimum.\\n\\nMany thanks in advance.',\n",

No issues with bowels.\\n\\nOther than that, I think about nice breads and Chinese food but not cravings per se. I also am not that hungry and don’t feel that starving feeling much. \\n\\nWhen I’m reading packets I do try to look out for carbs but I’m not sure if there’s hidden ones in the foods I’m eating?\\n\\nI also am drinking. Life has just got back to normal so Friday and Saturday I had a drink or two (vodka soda). I will continue to do this for the next few weeks because lockdown has ruined so many things.\\n\\nThanks for any help.\\n\\nP.s. gross but I feel like my breath is always a bit dodgy after I’ve eaten or drunk so can’t tell.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"During the pandemic I have become quite the coach potato. I stopped working out and picked up a few unhealthy habits which ultimately have caused me to gain roughly 8KG of fat. I don't really have a gut, but my face has blown up big-time. (Seriously, I'll post pictures if anyone is interested. Why does so much of it go straight to my head?)\\n\\n\\nSo about a week ago I decided to explore dietery options. I was already familiar with keto because of its popularity. The thought of a high protein diet appealed to me because my body still has some semblance of muscle that I want to hold onto. So I made the choice. \\n\\nFast forward to today and it's been 6 days since I dived in head first. I decided to lower my carb intake gradually and started out with 100g of carbs on the first day. From there on out I did 80 grams on the second, third and fourth and 50 on the fifth and sixth. \\n\\nMisc info:\\n\\nI was 114kg going in and have lost about 3kg of water weight since. I am about 200cm tall. I am now consuming anywhere between 2000-2500 calories. My daily intake was 3500-4200 prior to starting keto.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n1.. The second and third day were very difficult. I am a little low on energy but have been fine since. I've read a lot about keto flue. Does this mean the worst is yet to come?\\n\\n2. I drink diet coke? I long for sugar, but obviously don't want to waste my carb intake.\\n\\n\\n3. Can I realistically lose 10kg in 10 weeks if I consume less than 50 grams of carbs and consume somewhere between 2000-2500 calories while only doing 20 mins of light excersise bi-daily? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for reading. Any feedback would be appreciated.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Help!! I have been doing keto for almost a month, first time. I’m not trying to lose weight much, my main reason was for reactive hypoglycemia (no diabetes), which was also giving me terrible insomnia. I have talked to many doctors and nutritionists about, and they  have never helped me, so the hypoglycemia is self diagnosed. But has been a problem for my entire adult life. \\nAfter starting keto my sleep and energy improved greatly, I was sleeping perfectly for the first time in years! But starting a couple weeks ago, Ive gradually had more and more difficulty supplementing electrolytes. I have read the keto FAQ several times and I have been tracking electrolytes on cronometer for 5 days, but it is still difficult to know if I’m doing the right thing since I set the target amounts. \\nCurrently I’ve been getting 3500-4000 sodium, about 2800 potassium and 600-800 magnesium (supplementing 300 with Calm powder, the rest is food). I drink almost 3 liters of water a day. I’m eating lots of salads and what seems to me to be very healthily. Avacados, almonds, pickles, seeds, chicken, beef, nutritional yeast, wheatgrass, fish oil, multi vitamin...\\nI have also been tracking all the reactions my body has, to guide my electrolyte targets. \\nThis is where I’m really struggling because, as recommended, I’m trying to keep my sodium up. But I seem to be having bad reactions to salt, that I’ve tested several times. Right after consuming it, I get twitching everywhere, sudden BMs, anxiety, and worse of all super irritable which is causing problems at home 😖. And this has even happened after just salting my food with less than 1/8th of a teaspoon! So one day I tried cutting sodium back to 3000mg and it felt like I got keto flu again, I felt terrible (light headed, extreme fatigue). \\nI haven’t read of anyone else having this problem, could it be that too much salt is causing me to have low potassium? Do I have too much magnesium? I am also struggling to get a full nights sleep, I wake up after about 5 hours having to manage electrolytes, particularly more mag (to feel drowsy) and potassium (to soothe anxiety). I don’t want to give up but I am feeling defeated 😞. Has anyone had a similar experience?',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I\\'ve attempted keto 4 times and every time I\\'ve had to quit because of a tingling in my extremities, brought on by electrolyte problems. I\\'m certain this gets asked A LOT in many different ways on this subreddit, but I cannot find answers whatsoever, and I\\'ve tried so many different approaches, so I\\'m going to try to keep this concise as possible. \\n\\n* How difficult is it to have too much sodium, potassium, magnesium on keto? Should I be worried about overdosing or does that only happen to people with bad kidneys? I\\'m worried about noticing some symptoms, upping my intake, and then having a seizure or paralysis from potassium toxicity (this might be hypochondria, but I\\'m still too concerned to attempt it).\\n* How much water is too much? I\\'ve had about 2L of water today with 5000mg salt, 1250mg potassium, 400mg magnesium (plus food). I\\'m peeing what appears to be beautiful crystal clear distilled water, which makes me think I\\'m drinking way too much.\\n* Are the electrolytes balanced relative to each other or does \\'electrolyte imbalance\\' just mean \"deficiency or too much of\" a particular electrolyte? Do they need to fall into some ratio? Every source I\\'ve seen either gives a lower limit or a \\'suggested acceptable range\\', nothing about balancing them with each other, or going over the limit and getting sick.\\n* Are muscle cramps caused by any particular electrolyte deficiency? I can tell *something* is up because I can produce a cramp by flexing my toes - when it gets really bad a cramp appears nearly instantly.\\n* Are pins and needles / tingling caused by any particular electrolyte deficiency? This is the symptom that worries me the most, and the one that has caused me to pull the plug every time. I\\'ve seen online it can be caused by any deficiency, but that magnesium is often the culprit. I\\'ve taken 400mg today, which is apparently the very upper limit, but have not taken tablets on previous days until this point. I\\'ve got this symptom now, but I\\'m not sure if it\\'s because of the magnesium, so I\\'m worried about taking too much and causing a serious problem. If I\\'ve been deficient up until now, then would taking 600mg or even 800mg to \\'top me up\\' be a good idea? I\\'m using magnesium citrate.\\n\\nI\\'m on day six of my fourth attempt. Each time, although I\\'m drinking salted water, (lo salt, lite salt, table salt, you name it), and eating rather a lot of meat, I eventually get pins and needles / tingling in my extremities at night and have to stop - enough to keep me awake at night. \\n\\nI just don\\'t get it - some of the folks here can drift into ketosis just fine whereas it seems I\\'m trying to balance 4 unruly electrolytes in the dark, because the only concrete information I can find is \"too much or too little of an electrolyte is bad\".\\n\\nIf it helps: I\\'m of a healthy BMI, and I run 3 times weekly.

This for me was always a sign that I´m keeping my sweets and carbs low. \\n\\n\\nBut recently I decided to go more strict on keto, try to go on without cheats and it´s like I´ve lost the taste. After 10 days with clean keto I started feeling very anxious (I´m definetely addicted to carbs) and decided to go for Chinese. Nothing crazy, not like noodles or anything, more like seafood with vegetables and... ok, dumplings. OK, so the weird thing is that I expected to have an explosion of flavour in my mouth with the dumplings but... nothing. SO WEIRD. \\nSo I took the shrimps and like meh, nothing. And same for the beef. No explosion of anything, it was like eating a paper sheet. It´s not the restaurant because I tried my usual eggs, sausauges and cucumber for breakfast the next day and usually it´s like super savory and fullfilling and... nothing. \\n\\n\\nIn order to check if it was that illness we all know, I took a piece of dark chocolate and it tasted so sweet I wanted to vomit. And I can smell my shower gel so that´s not it. I mean, the sweet flavour and smell are there but magnified. It´s like I can´t notice the savory flavours.\\n\\nIm taking the usual keto supplements already prepared, with Mg, K, Na, vit D3, etc, the usual stuff. \\n\\n\\nIn summary: going more strict on keto, sweet flavours make me almost vomit and savory stuff taste like paperboard. Have you experienced this in your journey?? (It´s so annoying)',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Recently I wrote an article and tried to put together a fairly foolproof framework for losing weight with intermittent fasting, keto, and some slightly longer fasts as well.  \\n\\nI based the plan on research I\\'ve done over the past few years (different books, articles, podcasts, etc), individual success stories I\\'ve seen, and of course some of my own experience experience as well.\\n\\nHere\\'s a basic summary in case you find it useful :)\\n\\n1)  Start with time-restricted eating (TRE) for a couple months or more.  Gradually shrink your eating window, slowly, so your body has some time to adapt.  \\n\\nIf it\\'s working, keep going.  \\n\\nA lot of people have success and reach their weight-loss goals just by doing daily TRE. \\n\\nOther people plateau after a while, and may need to try something different.\\n\\n2)  Doing a ketogenic diet for at least a couple months can help get you \"fat-adapted\", and makes it easier to fast (and easier to lose body fat).\\n\\nIt also helps to do the ketogenic diet for a few days or more before any longer fasts. Getting your ketones up in advance significantly smooths the transition into fasting.\\n\\n3)  If you\\'ve done TRE and/or keto for a while and hit any sort of weight loss plateau, one option is to try some medium-length fasts.  These are great for breaking through plateaus.\\n\\nDoing a 24 hour or 36 hour fast a couple times a week is a pretty good protocol, but you can always adapt to your individual circumstances.\\n\\n4) Longer fasts (&gt;36 hours) are optional, typically they\\'re not necessary to reach your weight-loss goals. But they do have some additional health benefits, and can also speed up your weight loss.\\n\\n5) Once you reach your weight-loss goal, mix and match low carb, different fasting durations, etc to balance things out and maintain your progress.\\n\\nOverall, be patient, take it slow, and notice non-scale victories as well.  Your health can improve even when your weight stays the same!\\n\\nThat\\'s a high level summary, but if you want more details feel free to check out the full article (and I\\'d be happy to hear your feedback, or personal experiences):\\n\\nhttps://fastingwell.com/how-to-lose-weight-fasting/\\n\\nThanks!\\nBen',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I got my cholesterol checked a bit over 3 months into keto and got my results back today. Overall, pretty good, but could be improved. 3 months may not be that long a period to see firm results but at least they are going in the right direction.\\n\\nI've read the r/keto FAQ and it sounds like total cholesterol is next to useless, and LDL isn't the whole picture, what's important is the LDL particle count. I tried to get my PCP to test for LDL-P but she wasn't sure how (said that it was only really measured in clinical studies), but made sure I had Apolipoprotein A-1 tested. \\n\\nYou can see my cholesterol tracking since late 2015 here: [https://imgur.com/SMeZZuQ](https://imgur.com/SMeZZuQ)\\n\\n*Though my trigs were actually pretty low in 2015, the only thing I was doing differently was I went gluten free for a while just to try it. I'm not sure what else it could be, but those low trigs seem to be an outlier.*\\n\\nIt appears that it's the ratio between ApoA1 and ApoB that's important for estimating coronary disease, and while ApoB wasn't tested, its value can be calculated with reasonable accuracy if you know your LDL and trig scores.\\n\\n[https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2840-11-55#:\\\\~:text=Results,0.936%20(0.935%2C0.937)](https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2840-11-55#:~:text=Results,0.936%20(0.935%2C0.937))).\\n\\n The equation is:  ApoB\\u2009=\\u2009−33.12\\u2009+\\u20090.675\\\\*LDL\\u2009+\\u200911.95\\\\*ln(tg)\\n\\nSo, with one measurement of my ApoA1 (142mg/dL, which is good) I am able to get my ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, which turns out to be a little high at 0.92.\\n\\nAnother meaningful indicator of coronary health is the Trig/HCL ratio, which for me is good, at about 1.7, though in the past it's been not so good, typically at around 3 but up to 5.\\n\\n[https://www.beyondthebrain.net/blog/the-importance-of-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio](https://www.beyondthebrain.net/blog/the-importance-of-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio)\\n\\nSee my trig/HDL ratio over time here: [https://imgur.com/HQQBlbl](https://imgur.com/HQQBlbl)\\n\\n**Overall I'm reasonably encouraged!** \\n\\nAreas I want to improve are trying to get back to a higher HDL level (currently 50, but was at 63 in October 2020), and try to lower that ApoB level. To do so, I'm going to try to up my oily fish intake (was already eating salmon and mackerel at least once a week, if not more frequently), and significantly increase my moderate to vigorous exercise (I've hardly even been going on walks over the last 3 months). I'll also try to get better sleep, as I'm often getting less than 6 since it's that time after everyone else is in bed that I have time to myself. Also, coffee is associated with increased ApoB so I'm going to try cut the frequency in half. I have a small coffeemaker but it still makes about 20oz of coffee at a time, or 2.5 cups. [https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/apolipoprotein-b/](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/apolipoprotein-b/)\\n\\nAlso, will see if I can slightly reduce my saturated fat intake and maybe fry my eggs less often in butter, but this will be a lower priority. I'm already eating a good amount of almonds and pecans every day.\\n\\nThanks to r/keto for the encouragement and knowledge!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi guys! I\\'m on my third week of keto and I got a couple questions for you. \\n\\n1) How can I tell if I am kicked out of Ketosis by using a device that measures the amount of ketones in your blood? Scenario would be like I ate a lot of pizza and I wanted to meausre my blood ketone level before, after 1hr, and after 8 hours. After 24 hours Im assuming I\\'d be back in Ketosis. Not that I ate pizza this weekend, but I did have quite a bit of snacks this weekend (e.g. almonds and fat-based dip) which have some carbs. as well as a few crystal light drink which has 2 carbs. In the worst case, if I slip up for a day, a weekend, a week...do I lose my progress towards sustained ketosis / working towards fat adaptation, like is it reset? Or would I just gain a bunch of water weight and then lose it when my body re-enters ketosis.\\n\\nBasically what I am wondering is if I can be making ketones and be out of ketosis somehow...and if there\\'s \"lag time\" between my ketosis state and blood ketones. In other words, does my meter even tell me anything useful when id need it? \\n\\n2) Can you tell that you are fat adapted by any means (i.e. ketone meter) or is it all kinda subjective experiences? Its my third week of Keto. I am obese so its not like getting fat adapted will be hard, theres plenty of it.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Two weeks in Weight Loss and dealing with cravings',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Hey, \\n\\nLong time no see. Two years ago I posted about how I lost so much weight I also lost my shorts at the grocery store standing in line. Well I got off keto and gained all the weight back and tried restarting once or twice and just never stuck with it past a few days.\\n\\nThis time around I have been focusing on not looking at Keto as something I have to do, but rather as something I want to do and it’s been much easier. Just last night I felt like I was starving and didn’t give into my cravings. I treated myself to a protein bar and a glass of water and went to bed. In the past I probably would have gave in and got chips or something.\\n\\nI stepped on the scale a few weeks ago and saw 228 and decided enough was enough. I will lose the weight or die trying. I’ve been fairly strict keto since. \\n\\nI’ve dropped down from 228 to 215ish as of this morning since April 8th. From April 8th to April 12th I wasn’t fully committed but gradually started cutting out carbs. Since the 12th I’ve been strict keto and the weight has been falling off steadily ever since.\\n\\nI haven’t gotten keto flu, and I have not been supplementing with electrolytes at all as of yet and I’ve been feeling great. The first time I was really successful with keto I wasn’t supplementing electrolytes either and felt fantastic the whole time. \\n\\nThe second and third time I tried keto I started getting all sorts of heart flutters and generally felt like crap, but I was supplementing electrolytes so I think that may have had a factor for me. Not saying at all that others shouldn’t need to supplement. Just for me I feel better without doing so.\\n\\nTo all the others who are struggling with this as well: I recommend really digging down deep and seeing why you want this. I know I had to face some stuff internally that I didn’t want to in order to change my mind set on eating differently. I think that I’ll be more successful this time than I was in the past.\\n\\nI’m kind of writing this for myself, some motivation to keep with it. I’m feeling great so far and trying to remember I gained the weight over time and this isn’t going to be a magic bullet to drop the weight over night, though it feels like my progress is slow (I know I’m making fantastic progress).',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Just wanted to share my experience after one week of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) for any lurkers who may be thinking about starting keto. \\n\\nFor a very brief background on why I started keto and IF, over the last 5-ish years I\\'ve gone from 160ish lbs to 180ish lbs and back three or four times. Well, I\\'m 23 in a couple of weeks here and I\\'ll say my body is definitely not the same as it was in my late teens. I started putting on weight faster and finding it harder to lose than before, without really changing the diet or exercise regime that I did to lose that weight previously. I got to almost 190 lbs this time and was feeling pretty damn bad about myself since it was the heaviest I\\'d ever been. Enter: a friend who told me about keto. \\n\\nI did quite a bit of reading and preparation before starting, which I highly recommend as this diet can be difficult if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, but more importantly it can be very unsafe. \\n\\nBefore beginning, I calculated both my macros and how many calories I needed to be in a good 30%+ caloric deficit. \\n\\nDuring the first two-ish days I felt just fine. Adjusting to IF was easy as I\\'ve done IF before, only keto was new to me. On day three though I got two \"keto flu\" symptoms, I became lightheaded very often and suffered from nausea here and there. I had been tracking everything I ate and drank with MyFitnessPal, so after checking my nutrition tab, lo and behold I was getting less than 1/4 of the potassium and magnesium my body needs (you need to put your research into practice, gang...)\\n\\nAfter getting K1000 brand electrolyte mix, NO-salt, and a magnesium supplement and I started taking them, these symptoms went away completely. Fast forward to the end of day 7, yesterday, I felt amazing. I have more energy than I did before, I feel more motivated to keep up with my fitness routine, and I really feel like I have more mental clarity at work. \\n\\nI lost 8lbs the first week, of which I believe 3lbs were fat. I\\'m thinking this because I lost 5lbs very quickly and then leveled out with no weight lost for 2 days. The initial 5lbs should all be water weight I believe. \\n\\nSummary: if you\\'re thinking about starting out on keto, I would recommend giving it a shot. BUT expect the first week to be rough and make sure you really understand your macros and GET YOUR ELECTROLYTES!! \\n\\nExcited to see how much I lose by my birthday, which will be my 5-weeks-on-keto mark.',\n",

It was my 3rd time trying it and while it worked before as well, I never stuck with it for so long and so diligently. I also think that the lack of open restaurants helped.\\n\\nYou can see the spikes and lows, usually, my lowest weight was after a spike. I weigh myself daily in the morning and have a google spreadsheet where I track the date, the weight,  and whether I'm keto or not and my goals. \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HJOAiSY\\n\\nDuring December I had a few more cheat meals but out of the 240 days, 220 have been keto and 20 have been cheat days (9.1%). \\n\\nAnother thing I have realized this time around is that you can bounce back from a cheat meal quite fast, but if the cheat meal becomes a cheat day or if you have it too close together the impact is bigger.

       "  'selftext': \"I've been reading a lot about keto for a while, but the thing that confuses me is seeing tons of info about losing weight, therefore getting healthier, therefore achieving other life goals (like getting pregnant). The thing is my husband and I have been trying to get have children for a long time with no success, however there is apparently nothing wrong with us (according to multiple tests we've done and multiple doctors we've seen). Unexplained infertility, they say. My BMI is fluctuating between 20-about our weight. However, I couldn't find anything about people in a similar situation I could relate to. Are there any success stories about people getting pregnant when switching to keto? Without weight change? I need some motivation because it's been a very frustrating fertility journey and keto is the only thing we haven't tried yet. Thanks!\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Short-Term Weightloss advice',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Hey all! I\\'m new to the keto diet and would like some basic advice, and some insight from people more informed than me for my current long term and short term goals.\\n\\n\\\\-------------\\n\\nAs sad as I am to say it, I have put a lot more weight on than I have intended to. \\n\\nHere\\'s a quick run down of my history with dieting and exercise for any possible information about my individual metabolism. The info is accurate due to keeping a pretty solid history from meal tracking apps and phone notes, not fluffing any gains or losses for the sake of attention, feel free to skip if not relevant in your opinion or just too long. I started this all pretty early due to some bullying and being quite goal oriented and relatively mature at the age my fitness journey began :\\n\\n\\\\-I was quite a chubby kid despite being quite tall and naturally wide and ended up weighing around 240 lbs @ 6\\'0\" by the time I was in 7th grade. I was only active during the fall from (American) football, sedentary rest of year other than a few years where sever\\'s disease left me near immobile which is when I ballooned up to 240lbs. The following summer I figured I would lose a bunch of weight. Ate around 1800 calories and ran two miles a day. Chicken breast, rice cakes, and potatoes were, no pun intended, my meat and potatoes. Lost 25 lbs over that summer (unhealthily fast, I know, but puberty was kicking me into high gear). End up entering high school at around 210-215lbs at 6\\'2\".\\n\\n\\\\-(2017-2018) My first 2 years of high school, I slowly worked my way back up to 240 lbs, but having football in summer and fall, weight lifting in winter, and track in the spring as well as being educated and focused on my nutrition and weight lifting schedule. I didn\\'t follow any diet and had nights of eating junk with friends but my meals at home were basically chicken breast and potatoes in various forms. Sophomore year I was setting records in the weight room and was extremely proud of my physique and health. I was around 22% (fat caliper) body fat, but I could still run a 7:30 mile and the extra weight definitely helped with football. Also, most people guessed I was around 200 lbs. Uninformed opinions probably, but even now its hard to believe my weight at those size. For a natural 240lb high schooler, I was pretty darn lean.\\n\\n\\\\-(2019-2020) Last two years of high school was where I started slipping. Between getting a job at Burger King, settling down for a long term relationship, and most impactfully, my football coach pressuring me to put on more weight I ended up flying up to 295 lbs my senior year of high school. My weight room gains mostly plateaued from lack of nutrition and proper sleep due to work and school work load. \\n\\n\\\\-Last year I was determined to get back into shape now that I didn\\'t need the weight for football, but Covid had different plans leaving me without any available gyms and tons of free time and boredom to binge eat and experiment with substances, legal, but not for my age at 19. Can\\'t blame Covid too much. At the end of the day its on me, but I can\\'t say I was mentally prepared for the seclusion. I ended up gaining more weight and two weeks ago i weighed in at 330lbs. \\n\\n\\\\----------------\\n\\nAlright, now for the ACTUAL question and my current situation.\\n\\nEvery year, my family goes to Universal Studios (barring 2020 of course). In 2019, I started having trouble fitting on rides at 290 lbs.  Specifically I only had trouble on rides that had lap bars. Never had a problem with my stomach, the lap bars just wouldn\\'t go down all the way with my thighs. I had massive thighs due to my body type and 4 years of heavy squat ( 1 rep max 530) and deadlift ( 1 rep max 590) with attention to form. Certain rides I could go on with the help of someone pushing down on the bars or special seats (embarrassing to say the least), but the new Hagrid\\'s Motorbike ride was an absolute no go. \\n\\n10 days ago I quit the substances and started back to tracking my macros (high protein, 2000-2200 calories) and fitting in the gym when I can (2-3 times per week, working around my college and work schedule). I lost 4lbs in a week, pretty good rate with water weight loss. But doing the math, I didn\\'t think I would make the weight I wanted for vacation so I decided to try keto. 3 days ago, I stocked up on some greens, chicken thighs, and some low carb alternatives. \\n\\nMy current short term goal is to drop to 290lbs by vacation, a 30lb loss in 7 weeks. Before you understandably freak out, I know this is an unsustainable diet and have no intentions on making this a long term deal. My long term health will suffer from eating only 1800 calories a day from nutrient deficiencies and my metabolism will force me to plateau eventually. I\\'m including a multivitamin, potassium, and magnesium supplementation as well as a lot of vegetables to minimize any nutrient deficiencies. After vacation, I fully intend to up my calories to a sustainable range and, depending on how my little trial run with keto goes, continue it. Also, I believe my thighs are much less bulky than 2019 due to my lack of strength training during this last year. I\\'m hoping that will help along with the cut I am currently pursuing. My current net carb intake is under 25g/day, usually around 20g/day. The keto flu is hitting me pretty hard, but I\\'m staying hydrated and including those supplements as well as cooking keto alternatives. I\\'m rarely hungry, perhaps in part to my current subtle nausea in the afternoon. I feel good despite the fuzzy brain and weakness.\\n\\nMy current long term goal is to drop down to under 230 lbs within a year, get back into the groove with the gym and develop healthy long term eating habits in keto.\\n\\nI have no experience with keto, only the research I\\'ve done over the past few years and wanted to hear some opinions on my short term goals given my current situation and previous fitness history if it is relevant to any predictions or insight you all have from your experience with keto. I understand that it will help the speed in which you lose weight when combined with a caloric deficit and decrease hunger. Is this true and can I be confident in my current short term goals as I stick to a 1800 calorie intake in ketosis, starting at around 325 lbs as of three days ago?\\n\\nAre there any specific foods or supplements I should look into to help with such a drastic cut? \\n\\nAny problems with diet or risks I may be taking that I haven\\'t mentioned? \\n\\nAny recipes or substitutes I should look into regarding keto (I do have a nut allergy so almond flour is sadly off the table)?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you\\'ve read this, thank you! Any feedback and information would be greatly appreciated!',\n",

There's also a lot of allergy restrictions they have to take into account, and I'd rather that be their focus menu wise than me getting a steak. I'm obviously not upset about this, but it means I may go over/off keto for the day of the wedding especially since I can't just leave to get food inbetween the ceremony and such.

       "  'selftext': 'On March 31st of this year, I was 193lb (5\\'5, 24F). I had been struggling with weight gain over the last two years, first with quitting my job and then of course with the panoramic (lol). I discovered this subreddit, read about the science behind keto, and decided I would give this a try. Less than three weeks later, I am now 183lb! I kept a log of all the days since I started, and I wanted to summarize each week in case it helps anyone else starting out.\\n\\nWeek 1: Got started with keto. Eliminated easy things from my diet, like bread, pasta, and desserts. Focused on trying to get under 50g of carbs a day to start, since I was SO used to constantly having sugary things all day. Made some mistakes with not getting enough electrolytes, but quickly learned to keep track. Went to Easter events with family, where there were very tempting food items, but managed to just eat what would fit in my diet and didn\\'t have any sugary desserts. Quickly dropped (water) weight, which greatly motivated me to keep going.\\n\\nWeek 2: Set my carb limit to under 25g instead of 50g. Had one cheat meal for me and my partner\\'s anniversary (had steak but did have some bread, sides, and bites of dessert). Continued keto the next day and haven\\'t stopped since then. Some days were hard- I felt like the first week was the \"honeymoon\" period, whereas the second week really showed me that I\\'m going to make some long-term changes. This was probably the biggest test for me.\\n\\nWeek 3: Finally feel pretty adapted to keto. I now feel a steady stream of energy all day and I feel satiated most of the day. Lots of my cravings for sugary foods are gone. Since I feel much more adjusted to keto, I started to focus more on tracking calories and making sure I\\'m in a deficit. I also started my daily walks again. Feel overall great and excited to keep going!\\n\\nIn conclusion- of course like anybody, it takes some adjustments if you\\'re used to the average American diet, but the benefits for me have been amazing! I\\'m not even just talking about weight loss; I also can sleep easier and be more energetic all day!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey folks, I'll try and make this brief.  Since early this month, I've almost exclusively not been in ketosis when I test on my GKI Keto Mojo meter.  My values have been anywhere from 0.1-0.4, but mostly 0.2/0.3 almost every time I check my ketones.  During this time, my blood sugars are anywhere from 70-101mg/dl, but mostly in the 80's.  I know my carb level has been good (less than 30g/day total) and most days still 20 total or below.  I have just been much hungrier this entire month up until this point, and have therefore eaten, since I figure my body is telling me something... Mind you, I've been in a calorie deficit up until this point, so maybe my body wants to normalize or something, since when I do eat, it pretty much puts me at maintenance calories.\\n\\nI've plateaued with the weight loss, which isn't a huge issue as I've experienced plateaus before.  But in the past, I was still in ketosis with all my plateaus.  I just can't seem to wrap my head around my ketone values.  I'd like to think I've just become such a well-oiled ketone producing machine that my body knows exactly how many to produce, but it's just a bit discouraging... Maybe I'm putting too much stock in it and just need some reassurance from you folks.  I'm trying to do my best with listening to my body's signals and eating when hungry, but that's led to me really not doing much IF anymore.  I'm trying to have this be a lifestyle and not a punishment, so I'm trying my best to keep a positive attitude and not intentionally starve myself just to make the ketone levels elevate and see more weight come off.\\n\\nAt this point, I'm down 75-80lbs in 11 months, so I really have nothing to complain about.  But I just want to see what some of you more seasoned folks think about this, because ultimately, I would like my ketone levels to be higher to facilitate more weight loss.  Lastly, I did do a 72hr fast about a month ago, in which my ketones were sky high throughout and for about a week after.  I almost think I did myself a disservice by doing that fast because my ketones have been pretty labile since.  Once again, maybe I'm putting too much stock in the numbers, but let me know what you guys think.  Thank you!\",\n",

Cut to the pandy and I fell off the wagon like many people.  \\nAt the beginning of the year I started up again and about 10 days in I started developing right upper quadrant pain.  I assumed that I was doing something to my gallbladder so I stopped.  About a week later I still had pain and the long and short of it was I had a normal cat scan, ultrasound and labs.  The pain eventually subsided and I just assumed it was some random thing.\\nSo now I’m starting keto again and I’m 6 days in and that pain is starting to creep back in.  Does anyone have any thoughts?  I love keto, as a general rule I was feeling so much better on it so I don’t want to stop!',\n",

I also took potassium and magnesium supplements just in case.\\n\\nTo introduce myself to consistant exercise, I promised myself to do 30 mins a day of cardiovascular training, nothing else.

       "  'selftext': 'In 2017 I lost 100 pounds with strict keto and felt great. Managed to keep it off with on-and-off lazy keto until falling off the keto wagon completely at the end of 2019. In the middle of 2020 I tried keto again but started experiencing GERD symptoms that were first misdiagnosed as sinus and asthma issues. In December a veteran ENT immediately recognized it as \"silent reflux\" aka GERD and told me to do an elimination diet: cut out all fatty and acidic foods, coffee, and carbonated drinks. The elimination diet helped until I came down with a terrible norovirus (stomach flu) over St. Patrick\\'s Day this year; everything afterwards made my stomach hurt and nauseous as hell. Saw another random doctor - due to my PCP being overbooked - said my post-stomach flu issues was due to GERD and prescribed me to continue a bland diet and take 40mg PPI pills every morning. He also lectured me about my weight -- with neither advice nor a referral to a nutritionist -- which pissed me off.\\n\\nWhile the meds have helped, my weight continues to creep up because a GERD-friendly diet is kryptonite to people with PCOS and insulin resistance. I love keto. I miss it. And I desperately need to get back to losing weight because it is wreaking havoc on my knees and ankles. This week I\\'ve been 75% immobile - only getting up to let my dog outside - because my knees are so swollen and stiff with obesity-related osteoarthritis. I am also tired all the time because my body can\\'t handle the glucose from eating a bland diet, not to mention my hormones are out of whack. \\n\\nSo in a nutshell: I feel like I am stuck between a rock and hard place having to choose between saving my esophagus or saving myself from type 2 diabetes. I know keto will help **my whole body** feel better but I don\\'t want to disobey doctor\\'s orders by starting keto again. What I want to know is if there are some people here who manage to do keto with GERD that can be managed with PPI drugs?\\n\\nTldr; is there anyone here that does keto with GERD that successfully manages it with PPI drugs?',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Ever since going keto/low carb I feel my electrolytes were messed up, but I still can\\'t figure out how to properly correct them. Since you guys are electrolyte experts by default maybe you could figure this out. What would you say based on these symptoms and reactions to each supplements? I\\'ve tried to supplement and add foods in many different ways and nothing seems effective so far.\\n\\nOverall symptoms: Brain fog, effort to breathe (only on rare occasions I \"forget\" I\\'m breathing, low energy overall, threshold crampy legs.\\n\\nSodium: Makes me feel just with a little more energy and less lightheaded for a short amount of time. Taking more won\\'t help much. Serum is always around the mid-lower healthy range.\\n\\nPotassium: Instantly kills any anxiety and makes my breathing smooth, lowers cramps. The effects are very short lived and reverse into worsening symptoms in a pretty short time. Taking too much irritates stomach, increases brain fog and makes me  dizzy and weak. Serum is always around the upper healthy range.\\n\\nMagnesium: This is a real riddle. Magnesium takes a while to buildup in the body so it would make a lot of sense to assume I\\'m depleted, after all I haven\\'t been supplementing throughout the lowest carb periods. But I can\\'t tolerate it at all. As little as 260mg-400mg a day will increase sleepiness(will make me sleepy the next day even if I take it at night), cramps (yeah, literally a short while after taking my muscle will threaten to cramp at the next contraction), diarrhea, and brain fog. Tried most forms (glycinate, malate, threonate), threonate is the only one that won\\'t give me diarrhea, but same side effects. Serum is on the lower healthy range which could indicate subclinical hypomagnesemia but I can\\'t tolerate it. Go figure....\\n\\nCalcium: probably have been on a pretty low intake for a long time based on what I eat. Had a vit D deficiency a while ago, but was corrected through supplements and reached normal levels. Whenever I had a bunch of dairy or calcium rich foods I did not feel anything in particular. Serum is around the upper healthy range.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Bottom line up front: how much value do you place in MCT oil?  And how can I ensure that I\\'m getting a quality MCT oil if I buy one online?\\n\\nAbout me: I\\'m still relatively new to keto; I began the day after Thanksgiving last year and have been going great (with one 3-day period two weeks ago where I allowed myself to have carbs before returning to form).  I have lost 30 lbs since Thanksgiving 2020 (due in part to both keto and IF, not really exercising much yet); however, before my brief carb overload, I realized I was plateauing and not really losing much anymore.\\n\\nSo I started to finally keep track of my nutrient counts (I mostly just avoided eating anything with carbs, testing to ensure I never fell out of ketosis) and I realized that there are days when I have trouble getting my fat intake where it should be.  Don\\'t get me wrong, for the most part, I have been nearly spot-on with my macros (60/30/10) without actually focusing on hitting those numbers for months, which I was surprised by, but there are days where it gets out of whack.  (Usually those are the days where I have chicken breast for dinner, as the protein/fat ratio throws things off a bit).\\n\\nI decided to finally look into MCT oil, but as with everything, I don\\'t trust any company\\'s claims of being great.  I\\'ve seen far too much bullsh\\\\*t... I usually go to Labdoor to check for their rating on supplements, but they don\\'t seem to have MCT ratings.\\n\\nSo I wanted to come to you to ask about your preferred MCT oil; just the basic, no frills, MCT oil that you use.  Because I know if I search online for something, I\\'ll get 1,000 different product suggestions (with at least 50,000 usages of the term \"keto\" and 20,000 \"weight loss\" on the labels) and not have any clue which is worthwhile.',\n",

The picture shows January 9th vs. April 10th. \\n\\nIn the summer of 2019 I’d gotten down to 174 lbs. from 230 lbs., then my life situation changed, then Covid happened (excuses excuses, but I succumbed to them). By January of this year I’d regained everything plus 5 lbs., and was back at a point where the weight was getting physically uncomfortable. About half of the initial weight loss was from keto, and I wanted to get back into it because not has it been the easiest and most comfortable way to stay in a calorie deficit, I generally feel amazing on it.\\n\\nEspecially this past fall I struggled with getting half heartedly into it again and again, only to go off it way too easy. This resulted in slower (but still...) weight gain and feeling kinda hopeless. During a particularly indulgent December, and my feet hurting a lot after work days (fairly active job), I started to prepare mentally for a different January. Seeing photos from New Years Eve was the cherry on top and I was looking forward to taking back control. \\n\\nIt’s now been over 3 months back on keto, and I generally feel better than I did all of 2020. I know motivation is unreliable, but it’s still here in full force and I take advantage of it the best I can. I didn’t start out with any exercise goals beside collecting a bunch of steps on my Fitbit. Only very recently did I start c25k as I felt a genuine wish to sweat more. \\n\\nI try to stay at 20g carbs or under, allowing up to 25g if need be. The past 1.5 months I’ve incorporated IF and some 36 hr fasts and found that I absolutely love it, so that will definitely be a part of my journey going forward. This was not necessary for me to be successful with keto or weight loss at all, I was most interested in all the other benefits. Still, I didn’t expect it to suit my lifestyle as well as it has. I know I would never have bothered with this if I wasn’t already eating keto. \\n\\nSorry for this little wall of text, I just wanted to contextualize and explain what I\\'ve been doing. I guess I felt like sharing because I just feel so *hopeful* these days, and keto plays a huge role in this.',\n",

I paid no mind to macros since I didn’t know what a macro was... I just focused on eating healthy foods and made sure I had a big calorie deficit while hitting the gym for 45 minutes a day. I lost 30 pounds in 3 months. I was stuck at 166 pounds for about a week before I became so discouraged, I gave up. I hit a plateau and didn’t know how to break it. Instead of being patient and trying to work through it, I went back to my old bad habits.\\n\\nMy second weight loss journey was in 2018. I had hit 209 pounds on the scale... my heaviest ever, outside of being 230 pounds when i was 9 months pregnant with my son. NOPE! I started a low fat diet. That, working 2 fairly active full-time jobs, AND going to the gym, helped me shed 47 pounds in 4 months. My progress went downhill when I switched to 3rd shift at one of my jobs. I was stuck at 162 pounds and didn’t have the patience to break through the plateau. I didn’t give up on myself immediately this time, but I lost it over time and ended up gaining all but 5 pounds back within the next few years.\\n\\nHere we are. Round 3. Sitting at 204 pounds and struggling to stay awake past 6:30pm every day, I knew changes had to be made. I joined and followed social media groups for the top trending lifestyle: Keto. I read through so many progress posts and most people have done so well with it. I decided to look into this way of life a little more and read about carb restriction. The ONE thing I haven’t yet targeted! I then stumbled upon an article about carb sensitivity and the warning signs. I will be damned. I relate to every single sign. That day I discovered that I really need to limit my carbs and I decided that Keto is probably best for me, personally. \\n\\nI started this journey 2 and a half months ago in February and I’m already down almost 40 pounds. This time, with minimal exercise and working only one job. With this new diet, paired with intermittent fasting, there is no doubt in my mind that I will finally make it through the 160’s and maybe even reach my ultimate goal of 145 pounds. A goal that I have repeatedly failed to achieve for 7 years now. With the knowledge and experience I have this time around, I WILL succeed. Only 20 more pounds to go. The last 20. The hardest 20.',\n",

So I have always wondered, why do our nutrition labels not consider maltodextrin a carb?',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello, I have always been \"low-carb\" but am about a month in for a strict Keto diet. My primary motivation for doing so is to boost my focus, in addition to all the other health benefits.  Long story short, I quit caffeine and nicotine about a year and a half ago but my focus dropped off a cliff.  To make up for it I thought I\\'d try a real keto diet (not just low carb) and I take some nootropics like Lion\\'s Mane and L-Theanine. I manage to stay well below 20 net carbs per day and I intermittently fast using the 16/8 method. I can happily say that the combination of Keto + Nootropics has brought my focus back to the point where I can code (I\\'m a web developer) long hours into the night like I used to before I quit all forms of caffeine.\\n\\nThe downside to all this however is that since the first few days on Keto I have developed a persistent non-stop muscle twitch. It is mostly in both my legs (thighs, knees, and calfs), my feet, and occasionally my arms and eyelid. None of it is localized, it appears to be random, and I can always feel it at rest (so hundreds of times a day). All signs and everything I could read up on pointed towards an electrolyte imbalance (had a brief few days where I was certain it was MS or ALS lol). I decided to experiment and started taking a liquis magnesium supplement. The twitches subsided big time, although not disappear completely. To test my hypothesis further after a few weeks of taking the magnesium supplement I stopped just to see what would happen. What happened was my muscle twitches ramped back up from 10 to 100, and got as bad as they were when. I first started Keto. \\n\\nHaving said all that and noticing the correlation between the twitches, and taking the magnesium supplement and not taking it, my question for you fine educated folks is \"at what point do I stop taking the magnesium?\" I can almost say for a certainty that the difference in twitches is huge between when I\\'m taking it and not. Is there any other electrolyte supplement I should be looking out for to help with the twitches as well?  If these supplements are indeed helping with the twitches and they come back when I\\'m not taking the supplements, is there a point in Keto where the electrolytes will balance itself out and the twitching will stop? Thanks in advance!',\n",

I have been doing keto for a little over a month now and have a bachelorette weekend to go to next weekend. Friday night, we are staying in the cabin and cooking dinner; I've decided that worst case scenario, I will have a shake or eggs for dinner if I can't eat what is offered. My issue comes on Saturday; I already do IF so I am not planning on eating breakfast with the rest of the crew (I will just order a hot tea or something). BUT for lunch we are going to a popular taco place (White Duck Taco in Asheville, for those of you in the area). I have been scouring their website for nutrition info but they literally do not post anything (UGH). I think I can get away with the fish taco in lettuce with pico de gallo and avocado crema (but without their nutrition facts, I really can't track macros). I also was looking at the ceviche as an option. ALSO, I have no idea where we are going to dinner so I really can't plan in advance, but might just pick a salad or if they have a protein then doing that. My issue is, I really don't know how many hidden carbs are in any of these things! Has anyone had success on travels like this? Looking for advice, anecdotes, or any hacks that y'all have to offer! I really do not want to break my keto streak!\\n\\nThanks!\",\n",

I have all day long energy and don't get the afternoon doldrums anymore. I'm off my blood pressure meds, and I'm no longer pre diabetic. My bloodwork has been awesome!\\n\\nHowever, I've found that I have diverticulosis, and recently I had an attack of diverticulitis (basically an infection and massive bloating, swelling, etc...). I believe that it was due to eating some miracle noodles (basically straight up indigestible fiber) and more veggies than I usually have for our family's special Valentine's day weekend.  I was put on antibiotics and a scan confirmed diverticulitis. It was a few horrible days of feeling like there was a football in my gut, but it seemed to heal up rather quickly by fasting (just beef or chicken broth) for about 3 days. Then slowly adding in some basic foods like eggs and ground beef with salt only. \\n\\nFeeling pretty normal again 7 weeks later, I ate some dolmades (sausage stuffed grape leaves) and cauliflower falafel on Easter. They were all home made and keto, even the sausage. The falafel was made with cauliflower rice. But once again I had more very high fiber veggies than I usually do and started building up to an attack 9 days later. It wasn't quite as bad as the first time because I had a better understanding of what was going on and went to the Dr for antibiotics ealier, but it sure isn't what I would call fun.\\n\\nI am back on fasting for the last 3 days. I've only had about 4 cups of broth each day along with water, and I'm supplementing with electrolytes and salt. I'll start on a few eggs per day over the next week and slowly work my way back.\\n\\nHas anyone had success with fighting off diverticulitis with keto or carnivore? What was your experience? I feel I can track it down to days that I had high fiber stuff and probably over ate a little bit on holiday occasions. But I'm interested to know if others have had other experiences?\\n\\nI'll be having my first colonoscopy over the summer after everything heals up and I want to get my insides as clean and healed as possible over the next few months.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So I've been having this issue for over 2 years now. I feel brain fog, spacey, lack of motivation, hungry all the time. I generally feel no excitement. I can't drink caffeine because it triggers a lot of these feelings. I am 36 years old 6'1 270 lbs. I work a blue collar job and I struggle with it now. I used to powerlift so I have a bunch of muscle on my frame. I'm currently on Atorvastin for cholesterol and have been for a long time, testosterone cypionate every two weeks for hypogonadism, and I take beta blockers 10mg when I have to because I get anxious driving now because I'm afraid to get spacey in traffic. And as of 5 weeks ago my doctor started me on Metformin 500mg twice a day.\\n\\nI am seeing an endo and she put me on metformin just to try it because she can't come up with anything else. We have done blood work after blood work. The only thing it showed recently was my RBC count was getting a little high. My fasting cortisol and insulin have been normal. I have had chest and head xrays and MRI's and they found nothing. I have seen a neurologist and he found nothing. \\n\\nSo I came across a post on r/Brainfog touting the effectiveness of going full keto if you suspect you have hyperinsulinemia. I went ahead and did this in August. By day 3 all of my symptoms were gone. No more lightheadedness 2 hours after eating. No more never ending cycle of needing to eat. It was heaven. I was able to drink alcohol again with no long term effects. I lost 11 lbs and was down to 259. I was bike riding occasionally during this and that didn't affect me like it used to. That lasted 5 weeks. Then all of symptoms came back. Not as aggressive but I'd say 75% of what they were. \\n\\nSince then my doc gave me a Dexcom BS monitor to try. During the first 10 day run my BS was perfect. Now I'm doing this second run and I've introduced working out. My symptoms are growing worse. Any time I do any weight lifting I am starving for the next 3 days. Nothing fixes my hunger, I'm extremely lightheaded. I did 4 sets of squats along with some cardio on Wednesday and ate a sensible keto dinner after. Yesterday I felt the worst I've felt in years. No food satiated my hunger. Last night I went to bed with a headache. I feel my body retaining water. My BS monitor showed my BS bounced up and down all night. Anywhere from 131 to 86. The previous 10 day cycle showed nothing like this. \\n\\nI feel awful the next day if I go over my 30 carbs the previous day.\\nI'm not losing any weight like I did the first 2 weeks. Everyone says losing weight will help but whenever I restrict eating all my symptoms come back harder than ever. \\n\\nMy questions are this: could this be an adrenal issue? Could weightlifting be triggering it somehow? Should I take a break from keto? I keep hoping to get anther 5 weeks like I had in the beginning. Is this just hyperinsulinemia like I suspect? Are there any other tests I can request?  Any help is greatly greatly appreciated. Thank you.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I think some background story is appropriate. I've been always a *sports kind of guy* through high school and early twenties. However after 25, I started to gain weight. Slow at first and probably some can relate that each time I was on the scale, you say to yourself *this isn't that bad...*. If you keep doing this, get less active because of a hectic professional and personal life and include eating out, or choosing fast-food instead of cooking up something decent, it adds up pretty fast.\\n\\nFast-forward to the present, at 38, and the weight scale showed a scaring 102 kg (224 pounds). Now before I had tried keto, with success. The first time I saw that I was going to +100kg, I managed to get it back down to 94kg (207 pounds). Which is still too heavy since I'm 1m75 (5 feet 8 57⁄64 inches) but I was on a roll, right? Then Covid happened.\\n\\nSeated at home, permanently but lucky enough to still have work, bread and pastas were within arms reach and I started to gain weight again and an alarming rate until present day.\\n\\nHaving failed to stick to a keto lifestyle, since we all know it's not a diet, I decided that I needed guidance.\\n\\n## Pronokal\\n\\nI'm not sure how popular or familiar people are with the Pronokal method but in Belgium it's a *kind of* diet under the supervision of a doctor. Every two weeks I check in, measurements are taken and every four weeks my blood gets tested.\\n\\nThe diet consists of Pronokal products of their own, combined with 400 grams (1 1/2 cups) of largely green vegetables (very restricted which ones are allowed). Once you reach a certain target weight, you progress to the next step where you'll replace some of their own products with lean meat or chicken for instance.\\n\\nAt the end, you should be eating more or less keto-ish. I know or believe they re-introduce carbs into the diet as well at some point but I'm far from that moment in time. The doctor checkup continues up until two years after your last step to make sure you made the correct food adaptions and don't relapse.\\n\\nA lot of questions remain to be answered but it seems that I really need the doctor follow-up to motivate me and to continue.\\n\\n## Progress\\n\\nI started this new *adventure* on March 15th, at 102kg (224 pounds) and the scale this morning after a month indicated 90,7kg (199,95 pounds) so that's a loss of about **11 kg (24 pounds)** in one month.\\n\\nI'm sure the weight loss will slow down after this initial step 1 once I introduce different kind of foods again.\\n\\n## Surprises\\n\\nI'm really surprised that I don't miss the carbs, sugars, etc. I used to *really* enjoy food. Having two plates of pasta and ice cream afterwards. Eating lots of bread each day and drinking *zero* beverages. I was afraid I'd miss all those. Don't get me wrong, we're a family of four and I'm the only one on *a diet*. It's not difficult but sure the smell of french fries with steak from the other people in the family smells delicious. But I think a key factor to  the success of *this* and keto in general, is that there are no cravings. I'm full after eating, feeling full for a long time and **mental clarity** is insane.\\n\\nI used to be one of those people that would forget *anything* unless I wrote it down in some todo-list or a notes app. Right now, I remember work-related discussions from four weeks ago like they happened yesterday.\\n\\nIt's still a long journey ahead until I reach my target weight of 73kg (161 pounds) but right now, it's looking great and most important I'm feeling great!\",\n",

This is probable the 3rd time I am trying keto, albeit this time I am starting it with a 5 day extended fast followed by alternate day fasting (36 hours). \\n\\nNow the reason I discontinued keto last 2 times was largely because of my inability to have meat (chicken, lamb) on a daily basis. I also got an allergy test done and figured I am allergic to eggs. So the only options for me to do a pure keto is either to have salads everyday or meats every meal which is something too hard for me to continue in the long term. \\n\\nI am wondering if someone can guide me on a keto plan for vegetarians. Also, if I follow the 36 hour fasting protocol properly, is it fine to have lentils (50g carbs 20g protein) adding butter to it with some whole wheat bread, once or twice a week?\\n\\nAny guidance on vegetarian keto recipies would be great to. \\n\\nThanks for your help. :)',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Just to be clear, I have been doing keto for 9 weeks now, and I started using this scale one month after starting.  So the numbers and data it is registering is for the last 5 weeks only.  (In total, I have lost 17 lbs since starting keto on Feb 10, 2021).\\n\\nI wish I'd had this scale from the beginning.  It's really great, and tells me all kinds of info.  How many pounds of water is in me, how much muscle, how much subcutaneous fat, what my BMI is, etc.  Today I finally noticed something else, and that was that it is telling me how many pounds of FAT I've lost since I started using the scale.  It came to 2.9 lbs.  Of fat.  Gone.  Used up!  \\n\\nMy mom told me today I have strong keto breath.  I've been eating a lot of meats, (steaks! yum!), cheese, eggs, (God, so many eggssssss!), above ground veggies and pork rinds coated in butter, coconut oil, and natural peanut butter, nuts, and avocados.  I'm not watching my macros, because it's too difficult for me, and I'm trying to keep my calories under 1200 a day--  and I think I'm doing that, because most days I only eat one meal maybe two.  I've been doing IF without realizing it, so I know I'm doing this well.  I have not 'cheated' once since starting this.  I've got to lose weight for two foot surgeries, so I am SERIOUS.\\n\\nDoes it sounds correct to you guys, that out of 9 lbs, nearly 3 of those were fat?  I try to get on this scale every day, first thing in the morning. The more you use it, the more info it saves and adjusts and tells you.  It's pretty darn cool.  I didn't notice the info about the fat until today, because I'm legally blind, and it's really hard to see my iPhone and all of the data it is gathering. \\n\\nSo--  thoughts?  If this scale is correct, it's saying 1/3 of the weight I've lost is actual fat.  Should the percentage be higher?  What is the other 2/3 made of?  Oh, ALSO!-- I have been lifting two 8 gallon milk jugs every day now for three solid weeks, trying to build up some strength in my arms.  Five arm exercises, and 3 types of squats.  The amount of muscle the scale says I'm creating is very low, just a tiny %, but I'm trying!  I keep going....\",\n",

As always, I urge you to read this sub\\'s FAQ. It\\'s been my rock and I\\'m not even exaggerating.\\n\\nI basically summarized the FAQ plus my own little interventions:\\n\\n* Try to keep your carbs under 20 a day but if you do go over, don\\'t let it derail you, just keep them as low as you can for the rest of the day.\\n* Lean into protein. Make sure you\\'re getting at least 100 grams a day even if you need to go over your deficit calories to get there.\\n* Drink ketoade and use salt on your food. (I gave her the FAQ recipe)\\n* Weigh and track your food as much as you can. Again, if you can\\'t, don\\'t let it derail you. Do your best and keep going. \\n* Use a food tracker all the time, every day. If you stop, start again when you can. (She uses CarbManager, I did, but now use Cronometer.)\\n* If there is something you really want and will feel deprived and resentful without it, make sure you\\'re already full (if you can) and have one bite of the thing. Count it as 5 carbs (it probably won\\'t be that much) and then get rid of the rest. The first bite is always the best anyway.\\n* Be kind to yourself. This is not a punishment. It\\'s not that you \"can\\'t have carbs,\" it\\'s that you don\\'t want them. \\n* If you stop eating keto you\\'re not cheating. You\\'re just not eating keto. It will be there when you\\'re ready to come back to it. \\n\\nThat\\'s pretty much it. When she\\'s had questions I\\'ve answered them. She told me she\\'s gone off keto sometimes, but always gotten back on with the next meal. \\n\\nKeto On everyone!',\n",

       "  'title': 'Is the Keto Diet Right for You?',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"Although the conversation about the Ketogenic diet is widespread, many people still find it challenging to tell what is fact or fiction. In this article, you will gain insights into the myths and facts surrounding the Ketogenic diet.\\n\\n**What Is Exactly Is a Keto Diet?**\\n\\nThe Keto diet works on the principle that by depleting carbohydrates, you will burn fat for fuel, hence maximizing weight loss. It entails a gradual reduction of carbs intake and replacing it with fats.\\n\\n**Keto Diet Myths/Facts**\\n\\nHere are the common Keto diet myths and facts.\\n\\n**Myth 1:** You Can Consume Any Fat\\n\\n**Fact:** When practicing Ketogenic, people consume healthy fats. If you want to keep fit, avoid saturated fats, and focus on organic foods rich in fiber. To prevent any stomach discomfort, space out the quantity of your daily fat intake.\\n\\n**Myth 2**: Weight Loss is the Only Benefit of Keto Diet\\n\\nFact: Contrary to what many believe, the Keto diet has immense benefits other than weight loss. For instance, it enhances cognitive function, boosts gut health, regulates body hormones, and stabilizes blood sugar levels.\\n\\n**Myth 3:** You Don't Need to Exercise\\n\\nFact: Exercising is highly recommended when you are on a Keto diet. However, to achieve more out of workouts, ensure you eat adequately, and allow enough time for recovery. To exercise, you may need more carbs, and it is essential to up your carb consumption on workout days.\\n\\n**Myth 4:** Your Muscle Mass Will Reduce\\n\\nFact: As opposed to the myth, people who follow the diet while doing strength exercises gain muscles.\\n\\n**Myth 4:** It Is Characterized By Fatigue\\n\\n**Fact:** During the adjustment period of the diet, you may feel tired, but that condition will diminish with time. More importantly, not everyone experiences fatigue during dieting. However, if you encounter it, bear in mind that it won't last beyond a week.\\n\\n**Myth 5:** The Diet is for a Short Period\\n\\nFact: The duration of the diet intake depends on your health and fitness goals. In most cases, the standard period is between three to five months. After this phase, you may revert to your regular eating patterns for some weeks.\\n\\n**Myth 6:** There is no Science behind the Diet\\n\\nFacts: Several scientific studies support the Ketogenic diet. For instance, particular research shows that the diet was initially created to help epileptic patients regulate seizures. Additionally, the diet helps reduce or maintain body weight.\\n\\n**Myth 7:** Rich in a Lot of Fats and Proteins\\n\\n**Fact:** The diet doesn't contain high fats and proteins. Depending on one's training goals, the macronutrient is apportioned based on individual requirements. For example, the typical macronutrient split for this diet includes low carbs, high fat, and moderate protein.\\n\\n**Myth 8:** Causes Heart Attack\\n\\n**Fact:** Keto diet encompasses the intake of saturated fats, which doesn't cause a heart attack.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nThis diet can help you improve your fitness and health goals. If you want to succeed from the diet, it is vital to scrutinize the myths surrounding the diet and adopt evidence-based facts.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'fat adaptation question - glucose levels management',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Fat-adapted ketoers and their energy source management (aka glucose management)\\n\\nHello! I came here to get some clarification and confirmation of my understating of energy source management.\\n\\nSay, *a carb-burner* decides to go keto. Carb-burner\\'s primary source of fuel is carbs (aka glycogen). Once carbs (glycogen) is depleted from muscles and liver reserves, his body will start switching to fat-burning. Once he went through 100 rounds of hell of keto flu, his body is learning to adapt to using fat for energy (on the condition that carb-burner stops eating carbs). \\n\\nAnd we have *a fat-burner* \\\\- a fat-adapted person, ketoing for months. A fat-burner\\'s primary source of fuel is fat.  (Although he relies on fat mostly throughout the day/night to give him energy, after he ate, he will still have a glucose spike. Depending on food he ate, the spike will either be steep up and steep down (if he ate a bagel for e.g.) or the spike will be more like a hill (if he ate 3 eggs for e.g.). But he will still have an increase in glucose levels-&gt; meaning that this glucose will go into muscles and liver --&gt; **meaning that he will be relying on glucose for some time after food intake**. \\n\\nHERE COMES THE QUESTION(S) --&gt;) \\n\\nNow, about this last bit of the sequence - as his glucose goes up, his ketones go down. **(1)** Does this mean that he switches to using glycogen as the energy source until his glucose goes down/ketones go up? OR he keeps using fat as the energy source and carbs that he ate will go into reserves. **(2)** Is there a \"max capacity\" of glucose reserves? If his reserves are full (from previous food intake e.g.), what happens with the carbs he ate during the meal?\\n\\nSo, I\\'m my understanding, being fat-adapted effectively means managing your glucose levels. After you ate, you restore glycogen and use it as fuel until next meal. After few hours your glucose goes down/ketones go up and you start using fat for fuel, then you eat again and this circle goes on until you go to sleep. Effectively, following the above piece, you actually have a prolonged period of burning fat **only** after your last meal (e.g. dinner). When you practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) (with a lunch &amp; dinner regimen), you will use fat for fuel only during the night and until your lunch next day. Question number **(3)** \\\\- does this mean that if you do **not** follow intermittent fasting and consume something 3-5 times a day (doesn\\'t have to be full meals but something that breaks your fast), you effectively always use glycogen as fuel rather than fat because your glucose goes up and down and you do not give your ketones a chance to \"override\" glucose? Following the above - an IF is a must on keto because otherwise you just do not use fat for fuel other than at night. Here is where I am struggling to understand fat-adaptation. \\n\\nTo the title of this post - is fat-adaption all about glucose management as written above? \\n\\nI hope its clear what I mean and would appreciate your takeaway on the glucose management situation :) \\n\\n\\nCheers and stay safe :)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Keto Diet Plan for Weight Loss',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'The whole world is now combating a common problem of human life called [obesity](https://www.fitex.club/some-unknown-things-about-weight-loss-you-should-know/). Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.\\n\\n**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**\\n\\nA question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.\\n\\nA Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.\\n\\n**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**\\n\\nChanging to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.\\n\\nDuring the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.\\n\\n**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**\\n\\nSince you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled. Without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating, you may have mood swings as well. So here are some of the best foods that you can eat during your Keto diet.\\n\\n**1. Meat**\\n\\nMeat is a very good source of protein. It will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body. There are varieties of meat that are available in the market. Most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton, beef, pork, and so on. But here in the Keto diet, you can easily go for all kinds of meats. In other weight-loss diets, the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in. but in this case, you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein, you also need ample amounts of fat too.\\n\\n**2. Fish**\\n\\nSea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids. They are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health. On the other hand, it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the Keto diet plan. Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout can be very good options for those who are going through their Keto diet plan.\\n\\n**3. Dairy Products**\\n\\nMilk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet. Milk contains almost all kinds of micro-nutrients which are really necessary. It also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too. Other than that, cheese, butter, and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the Keto diet.\\n\\n**4. Nuts and Oilseeds**\\n\\nThese are very important parts of the Keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health. Almonds, walnuts, cashew, peanut along with flaxseed, pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in Keto diets. You can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy.\\n\\n**5. Vegetables**\\n\\nFilled with vitamins and minerals, vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the Keto diet. Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.\\n\\n**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**\\n\\nWhen you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.\\n\\nThe first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.\\n\\nOn the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.\\n\\nSo far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.\\n\\nThey are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.\\n\\n**Benefits of Keto Diet**\\n\\n1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.\\n\\n2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.\\n\\n3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.\\n\\n4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.\\n\\n5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.\\n\\n6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.\\n\\n7. It also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too.',\n",

(As in, how many grams of meat +  gramms of veggies + gramms of whatever the fat comes from) \\n\\nI usually eat 2 meals a day (brunch and dinner)\\nso a suggestion for brunch + dinner would be nice.\\n\\nThanks in advance!\",\n",

I set MFP at 15% net carbs, which put me at 69g net carbs for the day since my caloric goal is 1850. Unfortunately, with the foods I had on hand, I was so focused on keeping below 69g of carbohydrates that I didn't meet my caloric goal. I only ate ~800-900 calories each for the last 2 days. Thus, my percentage of carbohydrates was more like 20-30%. My question therein lies: is it the number of grams or the percentage that matters more on a low carb/keto diet?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'SW: 198lbs GW: 130lbs CW: 184lbs\\n\\nHello fellow reddit ketoers! Just putting my story out there more for accountability but I will take support too, lol! My goal weight is just a lower number and not what I am holding myself too. I may get there, below there, or be above. For me it is all about how I feel and look to myself, and not the scale number. I found this sub over 4 years ago when I first tried keto. I was 130lbs then, and was just trying to get rid of stubborn extra tummy flab. I got down to 122 and still had it, but that\\'s a whole \\'nother post. I did not phase carbs back in, and just started eating like I did prior to keto. Add in stress from a really shitty job, anxiety and depression and you get to me at 170lbs. Then I finally got a new non stressful job and COVID lockdowns happened. We ate out the whole time and maybe cooked 3-4 times. Once we were allowed back at work I was just ordering door dash because I am lazy and it was convenient. That\\'s how we got to me at 198lbs. My boyfriend also gained a lot of weight too, and we both were just done. We decided we would do keto, and we have been on it for about 3 or 4 weeks. To me it is the easiest diet I\\'ve ever been on and I can do it without feeling like I am depriving myself. I love that I don\\'t get cravings or hangry anymore and that I have to actually remind myself it\\'s probably time to eat. My only \"complaint\" is that I miss fruit. I am a huge fruit fan. My boyfriend on the other hand is a bread/pasta/rice fanatic so he hates this. He also hates all veggies except potatoes and carrots. But he is sticking with it until he gets where he wants. To him this food is just calories to fuel the body. \\n\\nI haven\\'t started exercising yet, but I need too. Mainly for my mental health but I remember my gym routines from 4 years ago and I was just starting to feel strong and see muscles developing, so I want to get back to that feeling. I have chondromalacia (cartilage is coming off the back of my kneecaps) in both knees and a birth defect in my back (spina bifida occulta) that prevent me from doing high impact things, like running. I LOVE running. Of course I love the thing I can\\'t do. UGH. So I suck it up in the gym (like my boyfriend does with food) for other cardio like a bike or elliptical. Anyone else limited in working out? What kind of workouts do you do? I think we will start by just going walking everyday, and I will add things in from there. I hate \"starting over\" in regards to working out because I hate feeling crappy (I am a baby for pain) for the first few weeks. No pain no gain.  \\n\\n\\nWithout exercise being involved I\\'ve lost 14lbs and I\\'m stoked about it. My real problem is patience!!!! i just want to be back at my smaller size and feeling super confident. A pic of me from the previous keto time came up in my timehop today and OMG please gimme dat back!!! I know I will get there, but I need to stay focused on the now.  I hope everyone is doing well, and staying well on their journey!',\n",

What's not fine is dismissing others who have managed to integrate Keto into their life their way.  \\n\\nThere are so many new folks that get railed by asshats that have convinced themselves anything processed is anti keto. And I believe these folks hurt the keto community. \\n\\nPersonally I think clean/dirty keto is bullshit. Some people have trouble with moderation so they choose a label to help them maintain their goals. But in the end,  nutritional ketosis is nutritional ketosis, how you maintain that doesn't matter as long as it works and is healthy for you.\",\n",

I'll start off by saying it's gone way better than I ever expected and I'm very happy with my results so far.  The first month I was eating really clean, but then I discovered all the keto snacks available.  Now every day I find myself wanting something sweet, so I'm having at least 1 of (if not more) quest bar, quest peanut butter cups, diet soda, sugar free jello.  The thing is I can't decide how to feel about this.  On one hand, part of the reason I gained weight in recent years was my sweet tooth, so I feel like it's a very bad habit to be getting back into.  But on the other hand, the whole reason I started keto was to lose weight.  So if I stay within my macros and continue to see progress, what's the harm if it helps me stay sane?  Just wanted to see how others felt about this.  Thanks!\",\n",

In 2013 I tried Dukan and I’ve got good results with -40lbs loss. That nutrition was very difficult to maintain, moreover I had also few health negative consequences. After I interrupted it, I bounced back to 260lbs. Then I tried a low-cal balanced diet I had a relatively lower weight loss and It was again very difficult to follow this kind of nutrition.\\n\\nMy dream has been to go back under 220lbs (100kg). I was really upset that even though in the past I got the target, I‘d not been able to stay there. I was quite desperate, and I couldn’t control my weight at all, and I reached again and again 260lbs.\\n\\nOne year ago, while I was struggling with my last low-fat/low-cal diet with actual poor results and lot of hardship, I was told about keto and the incredible result you can achieve with it.\\n\\nI started with keto, and I have to admit, initially it was very difficult. Big difficulties for me was to give up on my beloved pasta and pizza and that’s a real sacrifice considering I’m Italian.\\n\\nI was almost to give up, when luckily one year ago a friend of mine introduced an Italian brand specialized in low card foods to. They offer pasta, bread, cakes all with very low carb content (around 5gr CHO/100gr). There are also preparations to make pasta, bread, pizza and cakes home. Everything tastes delicious. You wouldn’t be even able to recognize differences with high carb food.\\n\\nThis way I’m now able to eat all my beloved dishes keeping my carbohydrate lower than 25gr a day.\\n\\nEating in such a way eventually I hit my target few months ago and I’m going further down. My current weight is 210lbs (95Kg)\\n\\nI haven’t felt my self so good and energetic since my twenties. I will stay on keto forever. That’s only joy and fun and no sacrifice at all.',\n",

I eat virtually no sugar on keto not even artificial sugar.

I still ate keto, I just couldn't order anything off of uber eats for some reason. I just craved broccoli, and spinach with a hamburger patty with cheese. So I had that for lunch, and the same meal for dinner. With an organic cookie, half of a brownie, and some chocolate pretzels. \\n\\nSo an hour ago, I said to myself I need more carbs, so I finally went with something on uber eats. I went with Wendy's. I got some nuggets, fries, and a burger.  BIG MISTAKE. The food tasted so badddddddddddddd, like ewwwwww. My organic burger tasted way better than the wendy's burger. After all these years, I finally know why people say to avoid processed foods.Cause I feel like shit now. I felt like the meal I had was not wholesome at all.

The 1st week went well, I lost 7lb and my friend lost 8lb (not that we are competing or anything).  So far so good, right? Well into my 3rd week I lost 2lb and my friend gained 5lb.  In the meantime both my brother and my mom got on the kick and the same thing happened to them.  They lost a good amount of weight the 1st 2 weeks and then it slowed down drastically.  After talking with my brother, his friend (in the nutrition field) mentioned a different approach that basically outlined the do\\'s and don\\'t with this kind of diet and set him up with a \"eating\" plan.  Did it work? Yes. Do I have a friend that is willing to set up a personal \"eating\" plan for me? The answer is no.  Do I want to pay someone tons of money to tell me how to eat? Also no. But I did some research and there is tons of it on the internet.  I\\'ve been reading the forums, articles, posts, you name it.  Everything I came across had conflicting info.  So the same friend that got me started on this Keto life style found the Keto Resource and the 28 day Keto online.  He swears by it, and he didn\\'t have to pay someone tons of money.  So what did I do? I paid the $37 (it was on sale) and I signed up for the \"challenge\", I figured why not.  Its cheap and if it works, even better. So far I changed my eating habits and I feel less bloated and not as hungry.  Here is the link if anyone is interested, I figured I\\'d share and maybe it will help some more people out.

So I did some research and found some conflicting information. One article said keto can cause it but only at first and that keto actually helps prevent it due to helping inflammation. Another article...  no mention of keto but other health factors. One says avacados are a cause but another it's high fat dairy. Almost all say high intake of meat(chicken, beef, pork), some seafood,  sugary drinks, and alcohol are a cause which blows my mind because I'm not eating high protein or high amounts of dairy. Has anyone dealt with this with keto before? Is it very common? I would love to know your thoughts on this\",\n",

Any weight gained from a weekend of carbs disappears by mid-week and I haven’t had dreams about eating carbs for the last 2 years.

       "  'selftext': \"I have been on the keto journey for around 4 years now, doing the roller coaster version (3 months on 2 weeks off). Since the beginning, I have been eating desserts with erythritol. Mostly Atkins desserts, and a few other brands. \\n\\nAbout 6 months ago, I started to drink decaffeinated tea in the mornings. About 3 months ago, I started drinking it after dinner as well. After eating my meal, which always included an erythritol laden dessert, and then drinking tea, the inside of my mouth would start breaking out in these ulcers/hives. They would literally be all over the inside of my mouth, and sometimes on my tongue. It took me a bit to understand what was actually causing it. It only happens if I drink tea after my meals. If I drink tea after my meal without having any erythritol, no reaction either. \\n\\nI also tried different kinds of decaffeinated teas, as I know some use chemicals in the process of decaffeination, but it seems not to matter what type I use, I still get the reaction.\\n\\nAny ideas what could be causing this? Chemical reaction? Or just an allergy to the combination my body doesn't like? Thanks.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"This is a question that has been rolling around in my mind, and frankly bothering me quite a bit. If you look at it historically, every great civilization in the world has been built on a grain. Yet we, who are having success with Keto, are not supposed to eat grain. (I got the idea about civilizations being built on grains from Jared Diamond, and his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, among his other works.)\\n\\nExamples: The far eastern civilizations were built on rice, the Roman empire and the civilizations in the fertile crescent were built on wheat and barley; The mesoamerican civilizations, that is the Aztecs and the Mayans etc., were built on corn, and potatoes. It was grains, and the farmers that grew them, that allowed the civilizations to produce enough calories that they didn't have to be hunter-gatherers all the time, and could therefore build on their arts and sciences.\\n\\nI've come to my own conclusion about why this is so, but I would like to hear from other folks on keto, your thoughts as to how grains and starches became such a miserable problem for many of us.\",\n",

I\\'d also like to thank the kind folks here at r/keto for the support and great tips. I am now approaching 4 months on the ketogenic lifestyle and have never felt better. Within a few short months, I have went from obese and depressed to truly a new person. I still have those pesky stretch marks but besides those my body has loved the lifestyle change. And trust me, being skinny and having stretch marks is a whole lot better than being fat with stretch marks!! If you are on the fence about starting keto, please take the leap and just go for it. The appetite suppression is one of my absolute favorite parts about keto. It has this weird way of making the \"diet\" turn into a healthy lifestyle. I never set a goal for myself and just kept trying to stay consistent with my macros. I am blessed to have lost almost 60lbs so far on my keto journey. I am finally approaching my goal weight but have no plans to stop Keto. People say keto is a fad, And they couldn\\'t be more wrong. Keto truly has turned my life around for the better. And I figured posting in the place which gave me the most support would be a fitting end to a great day. Thank you, r/keto',\n",

So if I eat a cheeseburger(minus bread and condiments) how do I measure that in fat to match it the ratio? Thank you.\",\n",

I\\'m tracking my macros on Carb Manager and even when I come under, adhering to the macros for \"Sedentary\" activity, I still can\\'t seem to get below 230/231. I even get in about 12,000 to 15,000 steps a night at my job and I still get no results. I don\\'t understand why out of nowhere, my body isn\\'t making any progress. My goal is 220lbs, so I can go skydiving in the summer and it really bums me out that I\\'m so close to the finish line and I\\'ve hit a brick wall. I know sometimes you can hit a plateau, but this has been about 3 weeks to a month now, with no progress at all! I\\'m just feeling really discouraged. Is this really normal, has this happened to any of you for this long? Any recommendations for overcoming this barrier?',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"1. Drink water before and after meals to suppress hunger and make you feel fuller  \\n\\n2. Stay hydrated, it's just healthy and helps any form of weight loss.  \\n\\n3. Get some exercise in, nothing crazy. 30 minutes of walking is all you need, maybe 3-7 times a day. Exercising is not required for weight loss in keto diet.  \\n\\n4. Try to eat as far into the day as possible so you don't end up eating too often.   \\n\\n5. Limit how many meals you eat a day to avoid feeling. On a keto diet, you shouldn't feel hungry very often because your body is in ketosis, so take advantage of that to decrease caloric intake. Make sure to diversify your foods and get some veggies in to get proper nutrition.  \\n\\n6. Avoid environments where non-keto foods are available. This is obvious but very important. If, for example, your family is eating cookies in the kitchen, stay in your room doing something else  \\n\\n7. Keep in mind that the beginning of starting a keto diet is the hardest, then your cravings will go away and so is your appetite.   \\n\\n8. You can still overeat on keto. No matter what diet or exercise plan you're on, if you're overeating, you'll see less results. Make sure that you're eating slowly and not having big proportions.  \\n\\n9. Best to limit yourself up to 20 carbs. It's a limit, not a goal, you don't have to try to hit 20 carbs. Realize that this is the recommended maximum to guarantee ketosis. \\n\\n10. If you mess up, it's okay. I didn't stick to the keto diet on my first try. You have so many more times to try again. Forgive yourself, realize you can't change the past, and move on.\",\n",

With meals I’ve had no issues, but the past two mornings I’ve taken them on an empty stomach because of intermittent fasting, followed with my usual coffee right after. About an hour later I felt sudden discomfort and had to vomit urgently. This happened in the exact same way and timeframe both mornings. After vomiting I felt fine. Coffee a few hours later, still no food, was also ok.\\n\\nI’ve been doing IF and some 36hr fasts for the past 1,5 months with absolutely no issues, and coffee on an empty stomach has been just fine.

I have energy to do things with my children,”* Kendra says.\\n\\nHere’s Kendra’s inspiring story, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\n\\n## Kendra’s keto journey\\n\\nMy name is Kendra, I’m 32 years old, and I live in the US Midwest.\\n\\n\\ufeffI started following the keto diet in April 2018. Since then, I’ve lost over 100 pounds (45 kilos)!\\n\\nInitially, it wasn’t easy. I used to overdo it on snacks, sweets, and fast food. My portion sizes were out of control.\\n\\nI realized that not only was I setting *myself* up for health issues, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure that run in my family, but I was setting *my children* up for the same.\\n\\nI decided enough was enough. A friend told me about the keto diet and the success she was having, and I started the next day.\\n\\nThese days, I cook at home and we rarely eat out. I’ve learned how to cook a variety of healthy and delicious meals. I can make just about any dish keto-friendly. I’ve also incorporated intermittent fasting. On most days, my eating window is 12 pm to 8 pm, and at least one day a week I do ‘one meal a day’ .\\n\\nOf course, there have been times when I’ve eaten high-carb foods, but eating these foods only made me realize that my body just doesn’t agree with them. Low carb is what works best for me.\\n\\nTO LEARN MORE CONTACT :  **sararubinstein00@gmail. com** *(remove space)*',\n",

Though I feel quite happy with this accomplishment, I\\'m overwhelmed with the feeling of hopelessness, and I fear that I will never consistently feel good/healthy; because despite my cessation of alcohol consumption, I\\'m still waking up multiple days a week feeling hungover. What does this have to do with keto?? Well. Just stick with me here. \\n\\nSeveral months ago, I also decided to quit a detrimental sugar addiction that developed after I quit alcohol. This is when I decided to make the change to the ketogenic WOE. (I did keto 3 years ago and really enjoyed how full of life it made me, so I wanted to return to it.) \\n\\nSo I\\'ve been making a lot of adjustments to try to better myself, but I keep having strings of bad days where lethargy overcomes my body (especially since starting keto this time around.) I can go several days feeling so energetic and productive, beaming with health and stamina; but then come the series of days where my body feels like one big heavy brick, and getting out of bed feels like a feat. \\n\\nWell, I had an epiphany yesterday that maybe, just maybe the hangover feeling and overall lethargy have something to do with an electrolyte imbalance and dehydration? So I did a lot of reading and came to the conclusion that I need to start supplementing electrolytes. I mixed up a lovely ketoade yesterday morning and happily gulped that salty concoction down. And ya know what?? Yesterday was great! I had energy, my brain wasn\\'t foggy, and I was happy! I thought, \"Wow! What an easy fix to an issue that has been plaguing me for months!\"\\n\\nAnd then I woke up today feeling like shit again. Even after consuming a few ketoades. \\n\\nI know I\\'m being verbose, but I just wanted to give a little bit of background so you all could maybe help me out. \\n\\nMy brain in so foggy right now that I don\\'t even know what question I came here to ask. Electrolytes? \\n\\nMaybe I just wanted to vent. I\\'m exhausted, and I don\\'t know what else to try.',\n",

I searched around and found that almost every question like this ends up being answered by the deafening roar of everyone saying: ELECTROLYTES. \\n\\nSo, to head that off, I promise you, I’ve been supplementing and tracking my electrolytes.\\n\\nSo my question is: At what point should I begin to consistently feel the benefits from keto (energy, cognition, etc.)?

Week 3 was even better.      \\n  Then my neighbor gave me 3 small cookies.  I decided I'd just have one a day, since they were only about 25 carbs each.

They were so incredibly sweet I can't believe they were sugar free.

       "  'selftext': 'Hey. I used to do 23-1 IF and keto and had great results while working a labour intensive job. This was a couple years ago by now and I\\'m considering getting back into keto again (just started IF again)    \\n\\nI was looking for meal suggestions though because I really like to keep things simple.   \\n\\nWhen I was doing 23-1, I was eating 1 omelette a day and that was my meal. It was 3-4 eggs, 0.5-1lb of lean ground beef with some vegetables and hotsauce and that was basically it. Though I\\'m less active now (not doing 40 hours of labor a week) so I\\'m not sure if 3\\\\~ eggs a day is the greatest idea with all the saturated fat but maybe it\\'s not an issue at all.     \\n\\nI never felt weak on that diet. There were days at work where I was hungry by lunch which kinda sucked but I never felt exhausted, lightheaded or anything like that and did this diet for months.  \\n\\nSo what are your favourite meals? Do you take vitamin/electrolyte supplements? By chance do you know if my omelette strategy meets all/most of the recommended intakes?   \\n\\nI\\'m considering keto again mostly because even veggie-packed dishes that are supposed to keep me full just don\\'t. Example: I literally just finished a 36 hour fast like 3 hours ago. I broke it by eating half a pineapple and then half an hour later had a banana and some oatmeal. That is already 500 calories and a decent amount of food but an hour later I was still hungry. I decided I\\'d make a stirfry. I used like 1/4 grated cauliflower instead of rice, a piece of haddock, cucumber, carrots, broccoli and black beans. Ate a full, average size bowl of that and an hour later I could go eat the rest. That was probably another 3-500 calories so in 3 hours I consumed 1000\\\\~ \"healthy\" calories and I\\'m still hungry -- the day hasn\\'t even started.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"(I posted similar 2 days ago but somehow disappeared)\\n\\nKeto for March - strict adherence except early on when I misunderstood some key ideas and didnt have macros correct. End of March here was Easter last week and in Denmark thats a 5 day long weekend with lots of visits and visiting, so I just relaxed for 5 days. Restarted on Monday with 1551kcal, 154P/20C/95F along with intermittent fasting 16/8. My weight fluctuates so much that its hard to say if I really gained weight back but for sure beer, candy and pasta were on the menu. Not worried about it. I ran for 45 minutes yesterday - felt strong so for sure glycogen stores available. Plan to run again today - maybe a bit longer - to burn out my legs - then do a 24 hour fast. \\n\\nSound like a plan? \\n\\nPostnote: Enjoyed the pasta and goodies but had a decent amount of unexpected guilt surrounding this. I mention because I think many would agree - in the course of a year - there will be times where its just very practical to suspend the strictness. I know I want to continue with the macros etc. for a few reasons (I feel better for one!), but learning how to navigate these schedules is a good skill. That month of being strict got easier and easier, then now, restarting, is second-nature almost. I think that will become the norm for me. Any changing of macros and kcal will be a function of targeted carbs etc., once other workouts are introduced after the lockdown is over. We'll see...\",\n",

Most of the time, I worked with major (and minor) food manufacturers for colas and beverages, crackers and cookies, snacks, sauces, instant meals, breads, sausages… you named it. \\n\\nHow to I make them delicious? Through scientific manipulation of flavours and textures.\\n\\nHow to I make them cost as cheap as possible for profits? Using the cheapest fillers (think gums,  starch/modified starch, air, water, palm oil, sugar, syrups), combination of above while maintaining the longest possible shelf life.\\n\\nMy job is to create the most delicious, addictive and profitable wonders.\\n\\nNow, why the confession? Because, personally I avoid these like plagues… I do not consume what I create. The only exception where I ‘eat’ my creations were duration product presentation and tasting sessions with my customers (I.e. food manufacturers), and secretly spit out on a tissue, unseen. \\n\\n..\\n\\nI came from Singapore, where we pride ourselves as food paradise. And as with most Asian families, my ‘old’ home diet were largely filled with carbohydrates – rice, noodles, and mixing in the modern fast foods and snacks. We were fat, very fat. I WERE fat. We embraced low fat diet think that would save us. Thanks America,  your SAD and my government.\\n\\nLikewise, when I was in University (late 2000s), low fat is (and still) encouraged in our product development and nutrition modules. Incidentally, I took biochemistry as well, and was some credits away to be a dietitian, if I want to.\\n\\nAt that time, the fat me was looking ways to slim down – which I manage to via CICO, but became skinny fat and bouncing back to fat. In combination of curiosity, frustration and google – I found The Warrior’s Diet by Ori Hofmekler, which then I fell into the rabbits’ hole of paleo, low-carb, keto, The Bitter Truth of Sugar (great video), Ancel Keys (fuck you), and Pure, White and Deadly (great book), along with countless literatures that are eyeopeners and equally suspicious. \\n\\nI. was. Mindblown.\\n\\nThings I learn in school about nutrition were wrong.\\n\\nI still remember the yelling from my mum and the ‘WTF’ look of acquaintances when I started the journey of keto.\\n\\n10 years later, I am in and maintaining my greatest shape of my life – visible abs, strong and energetic, I looked good, in fact easily passed 5-8 years younger of my current age. My (2 years ago) last blood test has 265 mg/dL total cholesterol, HDL of 66 mg/dL, LDL of 145 mg/dL, Triglycerides of 31 mg/dL. No V-LDL readings available but I am extremely happy with my triglycerides. My testosterone level shot up too. Doc told me to take statin lol.\\n\\nMy mum? She lost 30kg, very happy and look much younger than her peers too. I am happy that she listened to me.\\n\\nHowever, after all these, I still unable to convinced my dad and close friends. So I just keeping to myself now, to reddit, and to friends that need help and listens.\\n\\nI am glad to take this journey, and will continue doing so.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nP.S. my daily foods generally are – blended 2x chicken breast (thanks vitamix), 5-7 whole eggs and big bunch of greens. My rotation of fatty meats are pork belly (uncured bacon), salmons, sardines, beef, etc. Marco – 160-180g of protein as an aim. I do not measure my fats. I totally avoid carbs except functions.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Just wanted to share a bit about my journey. I have posted a picture of me at my Daughter's birthday party in October of last year and a picture of me present day. I have tried multiple different diets, pills, drinks, bars, and just about everything else you could think of. One of my closest friends was nearly 400lbs when his Dr. told him that his life was in danger and he needed to make a change. He researched the Keto diet and started it. I was amazed at his results. After seeing myself in those pictures at my Daughters bday, I decided to give it a try. At first I felt stupid for trying another diet that would most assuredly fail. I felt like an idiot eating my hotdogs and burgers without buns, I felt like a girly man switching from IPA beer, to no carb seltzers. I missed gorging myself in pastas and bread, and doughnuts (oh my god..the doughnuts!), but I told myself I would give it an honest try for a week and see what happens. I weighed in at the end of that week and had lost 4lbs, it was full speed ahead from there. The real reason I wanted to make this post is because there were multiple times in the last 7 months that I was stuck at one weight range and thought I would never lose anymore, it frustrated the HELL out of me, but I stuck to it, you have to stick to it! At one point it took me an entire month to get from 247 to 245. I started a 20 minute HIT workout on my rowing machine, 3 times a week and went fully religious on the Keto diet. I gave myself a goal to get to 230lbs (because that is the weight that google told me I would no longer be obese at my height lol). In the picture at my daughter's party I was 283lbs, today I weighed in at 231. If you are stuck and you are frustrated, I came here today to say...DON'T STOP! Get more physical, drink more water. YOU CAN DO THIS!\\n\\n[keto weight loss](http://Keto weight loss https://imgur.com/a/Y45KV5F)\",\n",

What really brought me to keto was going on whole 30 with my fianceé last year and then connecting some dots.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m diagnosed with Graves\\' Disease (AI thyroid disorder) and pretty much had it for as long as I can remember. I didn\\'t get diagnosed til I was in my early twenties. A little under a decade later, and at the time of undergoing whole 30, I went to get some lab work done. My Endo tells me that my Graves\\' was entirely gone. WHAT?! I couldn\\'t put a finger as to what happened due to other stressors going on at the time. Fast forward to about a month ago and I\\'ve gone down the rabbit hole of ketogenesis. All of the benefits from weight loss, boosts of energy, to possible reversal of some horrible illnesses. A light bulb had finally turned on and I gathered that my illness went into remission because I cut all the grains and sugar (although I still ate potatoes that I\\'d cook). This was such a wild occurrence, I couldn\\'t stop thinking about finally making the jump myself.\\n\\nI know I\\'m going to be starting with simple dishes. Eggs/bacon, salads with oil dressings, burger bowls, bone broth. I\\'m trying to figure out how to fit Japanese cuisines into this as well, it is my homeland, after all. One question I\\'ve had is what to do for the tare (broth seasoning). Idk if I can get past the shirataki noodles, so I may opt out of noodle options entirely. Eggs/veggies/meats will be easy enough, but the seasoning is difficult to put a finger to.\\n\\nDoes everyone in here regularly go to farmer\\'s markets and butchers? I don\\'t want to break the bank too much but I know I want as much lasting impact as possible. I\\'ve also thought ahead to get lite salt and mio flavoring for \"ketoade\" to fight the keto flu. I\\'m definitely starting with 1/8 teaspoon of salt to make sure I\\'m not overdoing anything. I\\'m really excited to see where this takes me - if I could rid my anxiety, hand tremors, fast heart rate, or to just generally feel really good. About another day and I\\'ll be set!',\n",

I was recently talking to the mother of a 6 year old who was diagnosed at the end of last year.  She asked how I got to a normal a1c, so I explained.  After a while she started asking if I ate normally on vacation.  I told her no, because my basal rates and carb ratios are all programmed for low carb, so I\\'d go through the roof if I started eating carbs again, and on top of that, if I\\'m on vacation, I definitely don\\'t want to risk ruining my day with roller coaster blood sugars.  Her response was that she wanted her daughter to be \"normal\" and not live with so many \"restrictions\".  I was left scratching my head.  Having food restrictions is FAR from unusual in this day and age.  And furthermore, isn\\'t going blind, having your feet amputated and being on dialysis MORE restrictive than not eating a candy bar?  \\n\\nI\\'ve also been told that the keto diet is \"dangerous\" and \"unhealthy\".  And a whole bunch of other things.  I just don\\'t understand how people can argue against keto, the results of which can clearly be seen, and then turn around and wonder why their blood sugar is 400+ and they don\\'t feel well.',\n",

I lift weights everyday with pretty intense training sessions.\\n\\nI had done keto in the past and the first week I’d feel foggy/lack of focus had some slight vision issues which made driving difficult (I’d stop to turn, look left, then right and completely forget what the left side looked like). But it would fade after the first week.\\n\\nThis time i went from 209 to 197 in 9 days (started incorporated light cardio at the end of my lifts as well). I felt exactly how i expected to feel, foggy etc. but after about 16 days of it i never got out of the carb crash and mental fogginess. Simple mental math became almost impossible. In the gym i felt great energy wise but i lost about 10-12% of strength on all of my one rep Max’s in the bench, squat and deadlift which didn’t happen the last time i did no carb keto, in fact last time i did keto i was making new person records in the gym. My bench went from 300 to 270 for example. \\n\\nI started eating carbs again with each meal but a much reduced amount than i used to. For example half a bagel with my breakfast instead of 2 whole bagels with my chicken, Turkey bacon and veggie breakfast. \\n\\nI had to start eating carbs again to get my mental performance back, my ability to do mental math at work and safely operate my car are much more important than getting a little extra shredded quicker.\\n\\nDid i do something wrong? \\nAny insight will help.\\nThanks',\n",

My confidence has increased dramatically and I was surprised out how stable my moods been. No more mood swings or days where I’ve felt unhappy for no reason whatsoever. \\nAt first I found it hard due to me being a big snacker and worst of all snacking on carb heavy foods like sandwiches. Anything that’s easy to grab basically. But once you figure out what foods you can have and what foods to avoid it’s actually very easy to adjust your lifestyle to implement keto.\\n\\nMy advice to anyone new is to do your research. The FAQ has a lot of great info on keto and it’s laid out in a way that’s easy for beginners to understand. Another page I found https://sites.google.com/view/ketodietfactsonline/home is very good aswell. Quick and to the point which is how I like to live my life! No big long article to read just info summarised to help you. I also signed up for the keto meal plan they have on the website but it definitely isn’t necessary. It just helped me because I’m very busy and work 55 hours a week so it saved me time in trying to think of recipes to make and all that jazz. It definitely worked anyway so if anyone’s busy it’s a very good plan to follow\\n\\nThe main thing to remember is keto works! Summers just around the corner but with keto you can have the body of your dreams by then! It can be tough but just think of the results!\\nLet me know what all of your experiences have been like I Love hearing a good success story.',\n",

But I’m new to actually caring about my diet and I’ve noticed a lot with reading other peoples stories and watching videos online that some food combinations works better for some and not other people and a lot of times people have to tweak their diet to their body type, exercise level, and the specific affects it has specifically on their body and it helps them tremendously. I’m confused on what to look for specifically in my body to see which foods have the most favorable effect for me. I noticed that a glycemic response varies from person to person and that’s super important, are there any other tiny details that lead up to my overall outcome that I can note down and do experiments with to craft the perfect combinations of food for myself? I know it’s better to sometimes keep it simple but honestly getting into the scientific tiny details is actually what I love about doing this diet, it helps me understand my body more and what i put into it so go as deep as you can. I hope my question was clear enough for you all, have a good day 😃  Also it might help to note, I’m a 25 year old female, around 190 pounds, more of an athletic build, a lot of weight around the tummy and thighs, I’m fairly active because even though I have desk job I average 11,000 steps per weekday and then I work out on weekends.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Ok, so im 18F and have been on keto for about two months. I really enjoy it, its actually been pretty easy to adjust and I have almost no cravings. I take birth control so I was expecting to have no issues hormonally, as I’ve had no issues for the past year and a half in terms of regularity. Immediately after switching to keto my cycle is very off and even a few months in has yet to adjust. It hasn’t stopped, it’s just irregular. Should I up my carb intake? I try to stay under 15g of (net) carbs per day so maybe I’m being too restrictive. I’m also only eating around 900-1100 calories because I’m usually not hungry enough for more and I can’t exercise due to a recent surgery. I was usually eating around 1100-1200 calories daily and weight lifting 5x per week. I’ve been worried about my hormones since my cycle has been off and I’ve heard keto can be a part of that. I’m also worried about not eating enough, even though I know 900 calories isn’t enough I’m just not that hungry on keto. Are there any adjustments I could make to maybe help keto work for me, or should I switch to something like a plain calorie defecit and focus on getting my calorie intake correct? If it means anything I calculated my BMR and its around 1360 calories, but it also said something about my intake for sedentary activity level (right now) should be around 1595. Im not sure if thats useful in helping me decide what I should do. I just know it’s probably not good for my body to be 400-600 calories short of my BMR. I dont know how accurate that is to be fair, I also understand that eating less than 1200 calories per day is unhealthy. Should I prioritize calorie intake or following keto? Again I’m really struggling to eat enough with keto, and I have a bit of a history of disordered eating and while I’m not struggling with that coming back I am worried that it will. I don’t know what to blame the hormonal issues on, and I’m a bit worried about not eating enough. Any advice would help :)',\n",

While in the past I've succumbed to cheat days that just never ended or went on vacations where it was very difficult to find food that was keto-friendly, this pandemic has actually helped me!  I haven't had a single cheat day that I would consider a cheat day.  I've generally kept to less than 20g carbs per day, only once or twice going up to 35-40.  I'm mostly OMAD but sometimes TMAD on weekends.   I don't really snack throughout the day, and whenever I feel those hunger pangs, I just drink water until I'm full and that satiates me for a while.\\n\\nI started at around 325 - that's my best guess.  I don't know exactly because A) I was afraid to step on the scale, and B) my scale doesn't go above 300.  I'm currently at about 275, so around 50 pounds lost in 4 months.\\n\\nWhile I have seemed to plateau a little bit scale-weight wise recently (seemed to be stuck around 280 for a couple weeks), that has begun dropping again.\\n\\nI've found that when washing my hands, my wedding rings falls off if I'm not careful, and it's super loose regularly.  I usually take it off when cooking dinner as I wash my hands frequently and sometimes forget to put it back on.  My husband has even brought it to me asking if I was planning on leaving him since I keep leaving it places lol.  Unfortunately it's made of titanium so it can't be resized, but we only bought cheap rings at the start of our marriage with the intention of getting nicer ones in the future.  Maybe this is the impetus for that!\\n\\nI recently found a fitbit and decided to charge it and wear it some more - I haven't worn it in probably 6 months, and now, it's so loose that I need to take another link out of the strap!\\n\\nMost noticeable to me, was that I can actually SEE my Adam's Apple now!  I went so long not even realizing I couldn't see it, but my neck was so fat that it was hidden.  Now that I can see it again, I notice how many of my facial features have changed, and it's all the more motivation to keep going!\\n\\nI truly have this subreddit to thank for all the encouragement, recipes, and general info!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '48 yo female  \\n5\\'7\"   \\nCW 165 GW 135\\n\\nI started keto three weeks ago, after not being able to lose any weight with weeks of 16:8 intermittent fasting. I\\'m not someone who has ever been able to count calories or limit portions, so it seemed like keto was the diet for me. I read about which foods to avoid and which were allowed, and made it my goal to consumer no more than 20g of carbs per day (not net carbs, but total carbs). Because I didn\\'t weigh portions or count calories, I can\\'t be sure I always made the target, but here is what I did:\\n\\n* Check the labels on everything that has a label, to make sure not to accidentally consume too many carbs\\n* Cut out sugar and anything with added sugar (occasionally using a pinch of monkfruit to sweeten my coffee or whipped cream)\\n* absolutely nothing carb-heavy such as bread, rice, or pasta. No legumes.\\n* Ate fish, seafood, and meats including beef, chicken, pork, and sausages, either sauteed or grilled and without breading\\n* Plenty of eggs\\n* Vegetables including snap peas, fennel, greens, avocado, radish, cabbage, broccoli, and asparagus. Carrots and cherry tomatoes in small amounts\\n* Fruits: raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, about 1/2 to 1 cup a day\\n* heavy cream in my coffee and whipped on my berries\\n* Spirits such as gin and vodka, as well as hard seltzers (2g of carbs each)\\n\\nThis was a huge change to my diet. It was difficult and I was sometimes miserable. The first week I felt physically ill and didn\\'t have a lot of appetite. The next 2 weeks I felt normal. \\n\\nNo change to the amount of exercise I get, which is not a lot. Mostly walking.\\n\\nFor the first 2 weeks my weight didn\\'t change. At the end of the third week I had gained 3 pounds.\\n\\nI\\'ve read on here about people counting calories, fasting with keto, doing \"macros\" (don\\'t understand that), etc. I just don\\'t think I could stick with a diet that required too much calculating. \\n\\nShould I give up on keto? Does it just not work for some people?',\n",

It was good for me as a newbie to get an understanding into what actually happens on a keto diet and how you can utilise its benefits. It might not be for the seasoned ketoers because you might already have a lot of this knowledge, but for people starting out or those who just want more knowledge it's a good listen imo.\\n\\nI'm someone who recently started keto for fat loss but would like to continue it in some form long term, without necessarily being uber strict with carb counting every day of the year, but understanding what is happening in my body and adapting to how it responds.\",\n",

I\\'ve tried Keto several times before over they years and lost 10 ish pound before falling off the wagon each time.  \\nI started reading this sub in late 2020 for inspiration and to learn.  2020 was hard for me like everyone, which caused some stress baking and the correlating stress eating.  In addition I had a severe 2nd degree ankle sprain in January 2020, followed by a horrible bout of sciatica in October 2020 that plagued me into the new year.  I was sick and tired of feeling sick, and tired and painful, and I knew my weight of 205 lbs at 5\\'5\" and age 40 wasn\\'t helping things at all.  I knew I needed to shed some pounds to be able to get active without pain.  \\nI made the lifestyle change one random day in mid January 2021 (I don\\'t remember exactly which day, I just remember which week).  I stayed on top of my electrolytes and macros with CarbManager and while the first week was hard, after that I was feeling pretty good.  Minimal keto flu.  Then, the positive changes started.\\nI previously suffered a form of insomnia (couldn\\'t STAY asleep through the night), which disappeared pretty quickly.  I live with ADHD which I\\'ve never needed to medicate to function, but HOLY MOLY, I have a mental clarity that I have never known before.  My back pain and ankle pain have basically disappeared.  Whether it\\'s directly due to weight loss, or reduction in inflammation, I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t care either.  No matter how you slice it, this lifestyle is doing amazing things for me.\\nSo, this gal sat at 205lbs somewhere in mid January.  Yesterday, I broke through 180 to land at 178.6.  I credit reading the great advice and motivational stories on this sub with my success. I was stuck around 184 for a couple of weeks until I read here that I should recalculate my macros every 10lbs down, and that really the only macro I needed to hit or exceed was protein and to eat fat to satiety rather than trying to hit the macro.  These 2 things together made the scale move down again.

Really serious with it, counting calories and meal prepping. Who would of thought it could be successful if you dedicate to it. A few months into the pandemic with Lockdown in full force. I'm down probably 40 or so lbs. Relationship ended and she moved out but that motivated me for some reason and about September or so I was at a huge milestone of almost being under 200lbs! I started at nearly 280.\\n\\nI costed for another could months and got really close to getting into the 100s! I'm pretty sure there was a month where I was depressed and lost motivation so I got off of keto thinking I could control my calorie intake and start working out. This didn't work out, my urge to overeat came back and I fully fell off the wagon. So that was 4 or so months back. I'm back up to around 260. I'm living in a new apartment, got my first vaccine coming up finally. Things may go back to normal. I'm currently on a business trip which requires me to live from a hotel for a couple weeks at a time. I'm ready to go back to keto and finally get under 200. I know it's possible! I think I may just have to stay on keto forever otherwise I just eat eat eat. Keto kept my hunger in check. I was hoping that this summer I would be beach ready but I got knocked on my ass.\\n\\nMy father died at 57 from a heart attack, I have heart disease in my family. I need to become healthier otherwise I won't last longer. I'm just coming on here to vent and write down my thoughts and maybe get some encouragement. That is something we can all use. Here is hoping I can get my goal of under 200 on the future!\\n\\nTldr; I tried keto with success the second time, lost 75 lbs but I got off keto and now I'm starting again.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"At the beginning of March I started dieting just taking an eat less, move more approach. It was working pretty good. My starting weight back then was 337ibs, and the lowest I got was 330.2, but I settled in around 332 and could never really get below that. With a little bit of frustration I broke my diet, and decided if I'm going to start eating badly again, start IF. So I've been doing IF for a bout a week now. Last time I had weighed myself I shot up to 340 ibs. So I thought I'd give that keto a try.\\n\\nI've been on it for two days now, and mostly been doing dirty keto (basically getting fast food and ditching the buns and ketchup) and staying below 2000 calories for the last two days. I was shocked to see yesterday I was 335 ibs, and even more so this morning when I was 332 ibs. I'm sure most of it is just water weight, and of course if I was 100 ibs lighter the drop wouldn't be so drastic, but is it common to see this sort of dramatic weight loss in the first couple of days? Day 1 I did a bodyweight routine my trainer sent me and went for a walk for about 30 minutes, but yesterday I don't think I broke 2,000 steps on my tracker. \\n\\nAs an aside though, I'm pretty okay with keto for the most part. I've had some sleeping problems ( **sparatic** napping during the day yesterday, couldn't sleep until 2 in the night.) but I've also read that reintroducing carbs too fast is bad and that it should be done over two weeks. There's a video game I'm looking forward to in early May, and while losing weight you sort of need to pick your battles, that release weekend I'm going to enjoy myself within reason. So I'm thinking of keeping my IF as is, and keeping calories under 2000 ibs throughout April, enjoy myself when my game is released, then try to reintroduce keto throughout May.\\n\\nI won't be doing dirty keto when I return though. I don't have access to a kitchen with my current living situation, but I think I can make a lot of meals work by just buying some pre-cooked hardboiled eggs and pre-cooked bacon, getting a rotisserie chicken, some canned tuna, and some things like avocado and mayo on hand. Then when I start getting tired of that there's no saying I can't get a couple McDoubles and ditch the buns.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So, I'm a firm believer in the Keto diet.\\n\\n(FEEL FREE TO SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH AS IT IS BACKSTORY BUT IS NOT NEEDED):&gt;! I have always been thin. In fact, I often got complaints from family that I was TOO thin. That all changed when I moved to Japan for studies (and I'm still studying. Starting uni next week). I was staying at a homestay and they would cook for me every day. The meals were so big, I managed to gain a few kilos. Now, I went all my teens without knowing (or caring) about my weight, so I have no point of reference other than my pants started to break often. After that I started living alone and got thin again. Then the big scary hit us all and I started cooking more. I took a look in the mirror and noticed that I no longer had that V thing around the lower ab area so I decided to check my weight. It was around 92.3kg / 203.4lb. I didn't think much of it until one day I weighed myself for the hell of it and it legitimately said 99.9kg / 220lb. The idea of ever reaching 100kg just never crossed my mind and I needed to get rid of the weight QUICK. So I tried keto and effectively I lost 15kg / 33lb in a few months. Then I stopped for a few months and went up to 86kg / 190lb, so I decided to do keto again.!&lt;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn the past two months of restarting the diet:\\n\\nI lost 5kg down to about 81kg / 178lb the first month. According to a fitness geek friend of mine, my IDEAL final weight would be around 77kg / 170lb so I made that my final goal. Here is where I need your help. I have been stuck going back and forth between 80kg and 81kg for a month now and it doesn't go lower than 80.6kg or higher than 81.2kg. I make sure to always wear similar clothes, and to always weigh myself in the morning right after waking up, after using the bathroom if I need to. I'm not overeating, in fact I'm only eating one small and one regular meal a day, and I'm definitely still in ketosis, rarely ever going past 10g of carbs a day. So, what am I doing wrong? I do have to say there is not much fat left in my body, but there definitely still is. Is it time to stop and switch to a normal low calorie diet? I did notice that it took longer to drop the initial 5kg than the first time I did the diet.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow to problem number 2. I have severe ADHD and take medication (since recently). Quite strong one, at that. One of the side effects of the medication is dehydration. It's bad enough outside the diet, but on top on keto, it's a nightmare. I have a few concerns because I've never mixed the two before now. Could my medication be affecting my diet and vice-versa?  (Not medical advice, just asking if it's a reason to stop the diet.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you read everything thank you so much and I'm looking forward to reading your advice. This is genuinely stressing me out.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Long story short, I’m on week 2 of keto? Been going great. Today i unfortunately cut myself washing dishes and got stitches. After 15 minutes since the injury, we were still cleaning the wound cause it kept bleeding everything was turning white and cloudy, hearing got muffled. I swear i thought i was going to die. I blacked out for a few seconds and was sweating like crazy. Once i came back, color wasn’t coming back yet so i had to scarf down some left over fries and tacos my sister fortunately had just got home with. Ate the food &amp; Drank Gatorade zero on the way to the ER and started to feel better.\\nI’m assuming it was cause of the low blood pressure that i fainted. Doctor said it was most likely vasovagal, regardless of being bother by blood or not, it still happens. But i don’t think it was that. I mean sort of but i really thought i was going to die. Like i said the colors started changing and looking out the window it was really white and cloudy, i could barely even see my neighbors window when usually i could their entire house, chimney, fence and even the apartment complex on the other side of them. my hearing was practically gone. I couldnt understand my family when they were trying to talk to me. It all sounded very quiet and it didn’t happen instantly. This all happened with in a few minutes. I’ve never heard of anyone taking their time to faint...\\n\\nI don’t really know the point of this. Not trying to bash keto, it helped me a lot. I broke the diet today and ate whatever i wanted (without going overboard) cause it really scared me. I don’t have a reliable source or guidance so I’m just winging it over here. :/ \\n\\nI’m really concerned about this diet with all the diabetes stuff i can’t get answered to. I only use sources that support keto but all i get is people telling me “don’t listen to haters”, keto supporter isn’t a hater... or “read the FAQs”. Yeah i did and it’s says the FAQs is not a doctor so do it at my own risk. \\n\\nAgain, I’m not trying to bash but I guess I’m just really sad now i might have to give up keto. I lost 14lbs so I’m proud of that. Doctor said it’s fine to keep going but didn’t really go into. All they were trying to do is get me in and out of there. \\n\\nSo can anyone recommend a safer diet for me?',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I\\'m totally familiar with maltodextrin and how bad it is on keto. My question is regarding the amount of Kool-Aid I make sweetened with pure sucralose powder. The idea of using the powder because of the maltodextrin has been vilified a ton it seems when I talk to people so I\\'m just asking here for clarification :)  \\n\\n\\n For the [Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/2c726085-4fab-4745-88fe-0f8145f6c860.93bc05d0c57f82606b4315ee6dbe3e0f.jpeg) I noticed Maltodextrin is after Sodium, so each serving has 10mg minimum of Maltodextrin because there\\'s 10mg of sodium in each serving. Preceding Maltodextrin is Calcium Phosphate, and if you look at the calcium at the bottom it says it provides 2% of the daily RDA. Under the RDA\\'s guideline for Calcium, it says that 1300mg should be taken in daily. 2% of this 1300mg RDA 26mg.   \\n\\n\\nSo if we assume there\\'s 25mg of Maltodextrin in each serving, that would make 125mg per packet right? So a gallon=2packets = 250mg of maltodextrin. Even if I were to drink two gallons a day, that\\'d leave me at 500mg or half a gram of Maltodextrin (or half a carb) a day form kool-aid, right?   \\n\\n\\nIs the ill response to these powders accurate because I\\'m missing something? I feel like I\\'m not understanding a specific concept or guesstimating the right amounts of ingredients. I mean, the [Cherry Variety](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919Gey0CqJL._SL1500_.jpg) doesn\\'t even have Maltodextrin in it. I originally got into this because it was suggested insulin resistance (because of things like the koolaid I make) is the culprit of why the last of my lower stomach feels like its been in the \"pre-whoosh\" stage for 2 months now and has what feels like the consistency of a water bed and extremely squishy.  \\n\\n\\nSuper sorry about the wall of text. I\\'ve been on a very intense cut for the last 5 months and my macros are basically forcing me to do keto as of the moment. So I\\'m just looking for answers :) Any input is super appreciated!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \" \\n\\nSo.. I started keto last March. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months. I've been maintaining it and losing a lil more here and there. I want to lose about 50 more pounds.\\n\\nMy problem arises now because I've become stagnant. I've hit that pesky plateau. I was looking into calorie deficit but I'm scared because I have PCOS. Carbs/sugar don't do well in my system and I gain weight super fast. I just wanted to see, if I were to switch to a calorie deficit, would I gain weight back due to the PCOS? I know that calorie deficit works, I've seen it, but sugars/carbs don't agree with me.\\n\\nI know factually, that quite a bit of the time on keto I was not in a calorie deficit - I lost a lot of weight really fast and I was eating whatever I wanted (That was keto, but portions and calories didn't matter. I was just dropping weight like crazy.) I also didn't exercise. \\n\\nNow I take walks etc and try to do what I can to help with weight loss but I've been the same weight for a few months. I'm still doing keto so it's frustrating because it's always worked for me. I wanted to see how calorie deficit would work for me (if it would) but I'm scared bc of the PCOS. It feeds and thrives with sugar in my body and I am so worried about gaining weight back. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDo you think if I swap to CD I'll lose, regardless of PCOS?\\n\\nHelp!\",\n",

If we’re only losing the same amount as a normal CICO diet, does eating 70g-80g of carbs a day from fruit and beans make that much of a difference to weight loss? \\n\\nThanks',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello all! Just wanted a place to put this out there. Long story short, been keto before and successfully lost 30 lbs. had a baby and gained it all back, and then some. I’ve been off and on since a couple months post-partum and have just been too stressed/overwhelmed/exhausted for it to stick. Little one is almost 10 months and although teething is *killing* us right now, we’re in a decent spot. Given this, I hopped back on this past Monday and have been successful again. Lost about 5 lbs, feeling in control with only a few hard moments that I ultimately defeated. \\n\\nHowever, in one night I gained 3 lbs and I believe this is due to lack of sleep. I fasted until lunch, was within macros, barely over calories, was done eating by 6:45 and had a good 40 minute walk. When all of those things line up, I can expect to lose *something* based on all of my experience. Even if it’s .5 lbs. it’s something. \\n\\nWell. I gained 3.2 lbs and I can guarantee you it’s because I slept on the couch last night and got just about zero sleep. My baby girl had a rough night and when that’s the case AND my husband is home (he works nights) I will go to the couch. This is because he’s up most of the night because his own sleep is completely jacked due to work and he can’t stand to hear her cry. To honestly make it easier for everyone, I go to the living room and close the door so he can’t hear her and I don’t feel pressure to go against the sleep training I’ve successfully done with her. \\n\\nMost of the time, I don’t have that much trouble getting some sleep but last night I just couldn’t get right. Maybe some other factors contributed to the gain, but I believe this to be the biggest factor. It’s crazy how it can effect it so greatly. My husband is back at work tonight, I’ll be back in bed and hopefully baby has a better night for a happier scale in the morning, haha!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'After years of being \"big\", I got tired of my feet hurting all the time. Figured my weight had some role in that so I started looking into keto after a niece had some success with it. I have a job that keeps me in the car most of the day and was eating fast food almost every day.  I had no idea my current weight because my wife\\'s bathroom scale wouldn\\'t go that high. Was guessing I was around 325-330. Started researching the diet, read the FAQ, tried a few recipes, and ordered a new scale. It arrived on the evening of 12/28. I weighed myself after dinner (I know) and was surprised to see I was 350.6 lbs! Yes, I needed to lose weight. \\n\\nI officially started keto on 1/1/21 at 343.4lbs. I initially bought way too much food because I wasn\\'t yet sure how much I\\'d eat on a given day. I know the recommendation is to do a 20% deficit, but I went with 35% and have maintained that throughout. That gives me a low fat macro and about 1500 calories per day (now). That\\'s a big step down from before when I\\'d sometimes have 4000 calories in one meal (I\\'m not kidding).  I started with simple meals. Eventually tried a few recipes - some I liked and some I didn\\'t. I\\'ve now gotten into a pretty good routine and vary my dinners through different meats and veggies while keeping brunch about the same each day. \\n\\nI\\'ve had a few week-long stalls along the way. I don\\'t eat out hardly at all anymore and when I do it usually leads to a slight weight gain despite reading menu nutrition charts and keeping my numbers down. After one fairly long stall I decided to try a fast (only water) - 11pm Sunday to 2pm Tuesday - and that helped a lot to get it started again. \\n\\nOn 4/1 I weighed 291 lbs! No April Fools there! If I can keep up the 15-lb/mo loss rate, then I\\'ll be at my initial goal of 210 by Halloween. According to the height/weight charts, my ideal weight is about 180 lbs. Not sure if that\\'s doable or desired, but I\\'ll decide when I get close to the first goal. \\n\\nFor a long time I made excuses that dieting cost too much because healthy food costs more than unhealthy food and I\\'m not wealthy. It\\'s cheaper to buy a pack of hot dogs and a box of mac n cheese than broccoli and chicken. Well, that\\'s true, but I\\'ve found I have more money in the bank now than I did then. I might go spend $150 at the grocery store (usually less) but then I feed myself two meals per day for two weeks or more. Compare that to a $15 (or more) every day in the drive thru (for one meal) in the same timeframe at $210+.\\n\\nI\\'ve finally convinced my wife to try it as she\\'s been wanting to lose some weight (5\\'0\" at 127 lbs) and she started on 4/1 at a 20% deficit. She committed to 30 under 20 for now, then she\\'ll decide if she wants to continue. She\\'s a big bread, chocolate, and milk fan so I\\'m finding some subs for her.\\n\\nAnyhoo... I\\'m pleased with the progress so far. I\\'ve gone down 2 pants sizes and am close to going down another. Had to buy a new belt. My seatbelt isn\\'t as tight as it used to be. And my feet still hurt some, but not as bad or as often as before.',\n",

Even back in my college athletics days (I was a rower for a D1 club team) my relationship with food, to put it lightly, was a coping mechanism.\\n\\nFeeling sad? Eat.\\n\\nFeeling depressed? Eat.\\n\\nBored? Eat.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t healthy, and I knew I needed to change something.\\n\\nSo after doing a lot of research, I determined keto was the best fit for me, and even though it\\'s recommended to \"slowly transition\" in, I just went full-in. I count my macros and weigh food out, and at the beginning, it was hard fighting the urges to cheat. But I didn\\'t give in, and as time went on, the cravings went away. I started walking more, and just getting outside in general. \\n\\nAnd after over a month, I realized something: I don\\'t need to eat to feel better, or just because I\\'m bored. I need to eat when I\\'m hungry to live, and yea I can snack from time to time, but food is for sustenance, not something to pass the time. And in that epiphany, I realized why keto works for me: it cut out my cravings and made me feel fuller, longer. It made me genuinely take stock of what I eat, and get smarter about what I\\'m putting in my body. \\n\\nMy goal is 200, and as of today I\\'m down to 238, but what impresses me the most is not that weight loss, it\\'s that keto has made my relationship with food into a healthy one! I may not stay on keto forever (probably going to carb cycling), but the lessons keto is teaching me now are going to last me the rest of my life, and I\\'ll be better off for it.',\n",

I can talk about all the benefits I\\'ve had if someone wants to hear, but I\\'m really here to ask for some advice regarding micro-nutrients.\\n\\nI\\'m prone to having anxiety attacks, unfortunately.  I\\'ve read a lot about them and Keto has helped me quite a bit.  But, I still feel that I\\'m not getting all of the micro-nutrients that I need.  I currently take a Kirkland brand multi-vitamin daily, I take some magnesium supplements, vit-D, and B12.  I also use Ultima electrolytes on most days.\\n\\nSome days I get this amazing sleep and that is the main problem.  I don\\'t get good sleep, generally.  I have an Apple watch so I track the sleep, hours, deep sleep, etc.  I got 10 hours of sleep and almost 2 hours of deep sleep.  When I get good sleep like this, I feel so much better.\\n\\nYesterday, I had a carb day.  We had sushi so I ate two rolls, and a few potstickers (gyoza).  I use soy sauce on sushi and such.  \\n\\nI\\'m wondering if I\\'m missing something in my supplements that I need for good sleep and overall well-being.  I\\'ve had high sugar days too and that doesn\\'t work well for \"carbs\" but I\\'m thinking that the high carbs like the rice were a good thing?  Maybe there is something in it that I\\'m not getting enough of?\\n\\nThanks for any insight anyone may have.',\n",

I am feeling great energy-wise and recon I have lost about 10ish or so lbs. I do lift on a regular basis and was previously a frequent regular at Cyclebar, however due to my job, I have been relocated for the short term taking away my one and only cardio routine. Knowing what was coming ahead of me for work and no longer being able to cycle, I decided to go with keto while in relocation for my work. Now that’s background piece is out, my macros have been in close range to Protein 117g, Net Carb 20g, and Fat 96g. I’ve been strict all month long but not tracking or weighing food, just going off the nutrition labels and guesstimating the servings that I want to take in.  I’m now at the point where I am not reaching that “hunger status” and wanting food per se. For the past week I’ve been forcing myself to get the protein that I know I need. My goals are to slim down and lose weight but not at a large expense of muscle loss. I am thinking about trying out fasting 24 or 36 simply because I am not feeling any inch of hunger(currently on hour 17 and feel great). I do still lift frequently, but as of right now only free weights and being active from work because of relocation. I would like to try fasting however want to incorporate it in a way that won’t deplete my drive and energy levels to work out and not lose muscle?

Last time I was trying for around 30 or less per day and able to drink like a horse. Now every time I drink I just feel like shit and my body rejects the alcohol hours later (even throwing up bile at times). I’m pretty young (in college) so this is incredibly frustrating. I know you technically shouldn’t be drinking on keto, but does anyone have suggestions to make this stop? Can’t keep throwing up every time i go out. I drink tequila by the way which is very low carb.',\n",

These don\\'t have to specifically be \"keto\" branded products, but anything you regularly buy from the grocery store.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSome of my favorites and their net carbs per serving in parentheses:\\n\\nPasta Sauce: Rao\\'s Homemade Marinara Sauce (5g, better than most sugary sauces IMO)\\n\\nMilk: Kroger® CARBmaster® Ultra Filtered Non-Fat Original Milk (3g, I don\\'t like the taste of nut milks and so drink this instead every so often)\\n\\nChocolate: Lily\\'s Milk Chocolate Style Salted Caramel Bar (2g, I recommend this whole brand but I enjoy this product specifically)\\n\\nSandwich Bread: Outer Aisle Cauliflower Sandwich Thins (2g, this is not \"bread\" but its great for when you want to make a sandwich, can be used for mini pizzas as well)\\n\\nIce Cream: (net carbs vary by flavor) I\\'ve tried Halo Top, Enlightened, Rebel, and other less known brands. I\\'d say Rebel is the best, followed by Enlightened, followed by Halo Top. Halo Top to me is more *creamed ice* than ice cream. This is somewhat of a problem with all these brands, but I\\'d say Halo Top has the worst texture overall.  Enlightened and Rebel are both pretty good, I gave the edge to Rebel due to flavor choices being more to my liking. I am actually going to try making my own ice cream soon which I\\'m sure will be better than all of these options. Still, these are good to know for when you\\'re lazy.\\n\\nFrozen Products: \\n\\nCostco Frozen Broccoli (2g, Package comes with 4 or so smaller bags of broccoli. Nuke the bag for 5 minutes and season how you like and you have some really good broccoli on demand.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI will add more to this list tomorrow &amp; maybe ongoing but I\\'m tired and wanted to get the thread started.',\n",

I’m 5’5F and I weigh 263lbs (yikes) and I plan on losing 100-120lbs or so.

I don’t want to get discouraged so fast and have unrealistic expectations. I know some people lose 10lbs of water weight their first week but I’m scared I won’t really lose any (although my intake is 70-76% fat 4-6% carbs &amp; 18-22% protein). I’ve seen a story where someone lost 100lbs in 4 months which doesn’t seem healthy but definitely sounds nicer than waiting a year or so, if I could lose the weight in 6 months that would be amazing but unrealistic. I’m eating no more than 1800 calories (so far i’ve been staying around the 1500 mark although today I only had around 855 calories [I don’t feel hungry. I think a combination of my bloating and I believe I’m starting to come down with a slight cold have been the reasons for my appetite loss] but I think 1800 is a good max especially if I’m staying around 1500 already.

Everyone else seems to have so much less to lose (most want to lose up to 30-45kg (66-100lbs)) and their advice/experience is often so different to mine and doesn't help me as much as I'd like because someone of my size has different issues (physically/mentally/emotionally) to face. It's extremely difficult to explain the differences to them because they just aren't this big and it's usually very small differences so they brush it off as insignificant (it's not to me) and that makes me feel very alienated.\\n\\nSo I really could use some exposure to first hand experiences and reassurance from people who've lost **at least 70kg/150lbs**...if that's you it would mean a lot if you could talk to me and answer some of my questions.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. How much did you lose and how long did it take you? What type of keto (dirty/strict/lazy/clean) and was it only keto or did you do other things to help along the way?\\n2.

When did you decide to start working out and for what reasons?\\n4. When did you start noticing you were actually getting smaller? Specifically in the belly region which is so far the least changed part of me measurement wise.\\n5. Is there anything you wished you knew when you started that would have made things easier for you to lose weight or keep it off? \\n6. What was your biggest struggle? How did you face plateaus and days where you just felt like it was impossible to get to/be your goal? I don't often struggle with this but when I do it's very hard because I don't know many people who have this much to loose, so I can't look to them and say they did it I can too.\\n7. Did you have insulin resistance and if so did it clear up or are you still watchful? Is there anything health wise I should be watchful for while losing weight? I've already lost my gallbladder (due to disease long ago), and I'm trying to ensure that I'm losing fat not muscle but if you have tips for that I'd appreciate them you might know something I don't.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So since March I've been on or at least tried to be on a keto diet. My house is a typical asian household where carbs are everywhere and is the main source of energy here so I didn't have a lot of keto friendly choices. I've been counting my daily carb intake and to be safe kept it under 20 grams everyday but I'd have some snacks at night which I still counted but I didn't think much of it. There'd be some days where I'd be like ah fuck it ill just go under 30 and ate some foods with some carbs but still trying to count it and make sure I wasn't going over. Prior to this diet I have tried countless times going keto but failing to maintain the diet within the first week but this time I really tried it since the first time I did it, I was on it for a month and lost at least 20 pounds but this time it didn't work. I weighed myself at 220 at the start and at the end only weighed in about 218. There were some times where I didn't know the carb count of some foods and I just ate it hoping it did not knock me off keto like at the last week I ate a dozen wings which had some breading on it. I don't know keto stopped working for me cos of the many times I've tried to be on it and didn't maintain it or I've just been eating the wrong foods at the wrong amount and at the wrong time. I've done my research and the next time I try a keto diet I will go on a calorie deficit with intermittent fasting. I'm really tryna cut down before the middle of the year. Any tips?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey everyone!  Well, I (33/F/164cm/SW: 300lbs CW:175lbs) have been on keto since February of 2019... I started at around 300lbs and I have been slowly working my way down.  I think I may be the only person I know who didn't gain weight during the strict quarantine here, but I didn't lose much during those months either to be fair.  I have been going pretty slow, in the last 5 or so months I added in intermittent fasting but generally speaking, I just lose weight slowly and I am OK with that.  I have always weighed a lot, when I am stick thin I weigh 165 pounds, I mean I am happy to lose another 10 pounds give or take but I am not fussed about it.  I am happy with my body where I am at.  I had sort of hoped that losing so slowly and using ample cream (and I mean seriously, I could not be more effing hydrated), would aid in not having so much loose skin, and maybe it did, but not enough... My loose skin is an actual problem.\\n\\nThis is going to be so much TMI, but we're all in the same boat here right?  My loose skin is a hygiene problem.  As we're getting into the warmer months here, I am struggling to keep under the flaps of skin dry, like we’re one hot month away from there being a smell situation.  My belly button is already questionable.  I don’t know how to talk about this with people I know, so I turned to the internet like everyone else does.  I'd like to think that if it were just an aesthetics thing, I would be happier with the situation, but I am honestly not sure how long I would be willing to play Tetris with skin to put on clothes before I considered surgery even without the present hygiene issue.  I know many people who lost more weight than I did and didn’t end up with as much, I suppose everyone is different.  I'm not unhappy with my body per se...  But it's hard to be super excited about losing 100 pounds and buying your first bikini when you have to do a puzzle of how to place your skin inside it every time.\\n\\nBut I want to know, has anyone here considered surgery?  Have you gotten it?  What should I expect?  What are some things you’re curious about if you haven’t had it? Or if you’ve had it, what things do you wish you had known beforehand?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I have been on keto now for only two days, but I felt ketosis coming very quickly. Mental energy is at the top, physical energy varies depending on factors. Since I started OMAD at the same time as keto, I rarely ever have any energy when trying to work out. But I realize that my body just needs to adapt. Overall I feel great.\\n\\nBut a few things worry me. First of all, I experience muscle cramps and somewhat of a headache unless I drink salt water every two hours. I bought some electrolyte powder as well with sodium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. I feel really great after taking that stuff, and I feel like I need to take it probably 3 times per day, and I wouldn\\'t say that I\\'m really that active right now. I know that you urinate a lot on keto and electrolyte imbalances are a pretty common thing, but my question is; \\n\\n**1) Do I need to replenish these amounts of electrolytes all the time when I\\'m on keto, or does my body kind of adapt to it after a few weeks?** I know it doesn\\'t really work that way, but I figure the body must find a system to kind of keep things in needs, and not flush it, right? I mean I must take a lot of electrolytes just to try to prevent my muscles from twitching. And my joints from hurting and getting stiff.\\n\\n**2) Does the diarrhoea subside when my body gets fat adapted?** At least yesterday, I had to shit water at least 3 times after my meal. I realize that it\\'s a common side effect during the initial stages of ketosis (or during \"keto flu\"), but the body adapts to it, right? I\\'ve got some probiotic pills at home, which only usually makes me need to shit more and not necessarily make it better, but I can try those. I ate some saurkraut today with my meal and I hope that it makes some difference. I think there were some undigested pieces today too, yellow/dark yellow pieces, circa 0,5 cm/0,2\".\\n\\n**3) What are the general symptoms of being dehydrated, except for being thirsty?** Can dehydration cause muscle twitches too etc?\\n\\n**4) How long time does it take before I can get a little bit of physical energy to work out?** I must be very careful right now, a little too much and I just get generally drained. I don\\'t think working out really is a good idea right now, since I might have muscle catabolism if I do so.\\n\\n**5) Is a high conjugated bilirubin level bad in combination with keto?** I saw on my recent blood test that I had a pretty high conjugated bilirubin level. All the other liver enzyme levels etc were all fine. But is this worries me slightly, since the liver is part of what metabolizes fat, or the primary part  in the process. I figure that I feel fine in general at least mentally, and no real abnormal colours of urine or stool, so I should be fine, right?',\n",

I can add macadamia nuts in too for a snack, as they are well tolerated. \\n\\nI have ketoaide supplemented to make up the minor shortcomings when it comes to electrolytes too, and the food itself is well salted. \\n\\nEach day has around 100g of butter total added to meals, in addition to using fatty meats such as chicken thigh and beef shin. It's also the only way I can add variety by switching meats. \\n\\nSorry for the long post, but if I eat this way in addition to keeping on top of electrolytes and supplements, I should be fine right?\\n\\nSymptoms of my illnesses have reduced significantly since switching to clean fresh foods and avoiding fermented products such as coffee and cured meat. I just want to make sure I won't be killing myself by eating like this!\\n\\nThank you in advance lovely people :)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '[Update](https://imgur.com/gallery/wROScxF)\\n\\nJourney so far. I started keto on 12-2019, I was 326 lbs and noticed my quality of life was poor. I went to a Dr who does medically supervised weight loss and I knew if I followed his instructions I would have success. I already knew lots about it, but he taught me all about the keto diet and told me to follow the carb/protein/fat numbers he set for me, and gave me basically a large FAQ folder to take with me. For the first couple months I saw him every two weeks, with weigh ins that provided a printout of my progress with nifty little graphs and all. We would talk about what kinds of things I was eating, how I was feeling, etc. and would be a coach/counselor/cheerleader. Once I was adapted to the lifestyle we moved to 3 weeks between appointments. I looked forward to my time with him and tried to avoid weighing myself outside of his office so it felt like a treat to see my new number. Once I had lost a good amount of weight, and my energy was high, he got me to start working out. I got a gym membership and was going 3-4 days a week!  I loved my gym days and was shocked that it had taken me so long to go. Everything was going perfect, then, Covid. I was actually at the gym when I got the text that they would be closing indefinitely in a few hours. No biggie, I went to the store on my way home to buy resistance bands medicine balls among other things to work out in my garage. I got everything set up, and never used it once. Going to my garage to work out didn’t have the same feel of going to the gym, and I just couldn’t do it. It’s ok though, I’ll just stick to the diet. By this time, no in person Dr appointments allowed. So I could no longer weigh in and get my cool graphs. I tried zoom style appointments but it wasn’t the same. I kept eating keto and on April 30, 2020 I was 262 lbs. 64 pounds lost in less than 5 months!!!! Incredible!!!  Well that was the lowest number I would see on the scale. I slowly started cheating here and there, mostly for comfort in this crazy new world we were in. Before long I was 100% off keto. For a long time I stayed pretty close to my lowest weight, I had learned about portion control, only eating when I needed to and stopping when my body told me to. Eventually I fell back into over eating, eating for fun, and comfort, and to satiate boredom. Pounds started rising and me new clothes got tight. I didn’t step on a scale for a long time. 1-1-2021, I stepped on a scale...312.  I was so upset and disappointed, I promised myself I would never go back to where I started. The next morning, I was 100% keto! I dropped down to 295 quick, and stayed there, for about 3 weeks. What was I doing wrong?  I soon realized I was using all the “keto” “low carb” products from the grocery store. I cut those all out and went back to basics. Meat, cheese, eggs, avocado, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts. That’s it, only thing I will put in my body. Today I am 272 and 10 lbs away from my first goal of getting back to where I was a year ago. I am hoping to hit my goal of 262 by April 30, the date I hit 262 last year.  I just want to end by saying thank you to everyone who shares their stories here. I read them often and you all give me tons of motivation. Sorry for the long post, but it’s been a long journey so far. Have a great day, and thanks for listening!!',\n",

[As I mentioned in my 3-months-in (well, just short of 3 months) first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mce27a/my_keto_journey_thus_far_3_months_in_long/) in /r/keto, I had experienced. pretty strong progress though with some periods of frustrating (though expected, per the FAQ) slow loss. I recently realized, however, that I was probably sabotaging my progress somewhat; despite being fairly strict and tracking my intake somewhat regularly, I was eating unaccounted-for nuts and breaking my intermittent-fasting with late-night Scotch (double-whammy, calories + the interrupted IF). Needless to say I wasn't adding those nuts or drinks to my log in MFP.\\n\\nStarting on 3/21 I started tracking every nut (in addition to everything else I'm eating) and stopped drinking as much, and definitely no more IF-busting drinks. The nut-tracking isn't as bad as it sounds - using my scale I know that 2 toasted pecans is about 5g, and 2 almonds is about 2g, so it's fairly easy to track that in MFP in my head now without the scale.\\n\\nCoincidence or not, you can see a marked improvement in the rate of loss since 3/21, really kicking in on 3/26 where the weight started falling off. The only thing I really changed was what I mentioned above. **That's almost 5lbs in the 10 days since 3/25!** \\n\\nMy caloric intake is lower since 3/21 overall, but I'm still hitting my protein macro of about 120g/day\\n\\nThanks to /r/keto!

       "  'selftext': '\\nOkay, quickest backstory: obese my whole adult life. In 2014-2016, I had lost 60lbs/27kg with Keto. (You can see in my post history how well I had done once). Moved to Korea in 2016, gained everything back plus a little more (and hypothyroidismㅠㅠ)\\n\\nAnyway!\\n\\nSince March 2020, I started fixing my habits again. I’ve been Keto since November 2020!\\n\\nAs of today, I’ve lost 63lbs/28.5kg! I’m 7lbs away from getting back to my low weight a few years ago, but still have much more to lose from there.\\n\\nBUT THE NSV is something I could only feel in Korea...!!\\n\\nKoreans are quite... truthful lol when it comes to weight. Sometimes brutally honest ㅋㅋ They are also just generally thinner, and there’s a high expectation for appearances here. So being obese in a country like Korea has been extra rough on my self-esteem (but I’m working through that, don’t worry!). I’m still AT LEAST 54lbs/24.4kg away from a “healthy” weight. So I didn’t expect comments for a while, but good lord at least I’m feeling amazing again, finally. \\n\\n\\nI catch the bus to work in the morning and always wait with a middle-aged woman who lives near me. I’m talking over 4 years of us waiting together. She doesn’t speak English, and I speak kindergarten Korean at best. I understand more than I can say, but we always manage to have little “chats”. She takes care of me like picking cat hairs off my shirts, holding an umbrella over me, etc. It’s a cute relationship we have!\\n\\nThis week, she asks me (always in Korean) if I’ve lost weight!! I was SHOCKED she noticed AND said something! I told her how much, explained “no carbs” and “no exercise yet” haha. She was amazed. Today (a few days later), she said again how pretty I look and then tells me she didn’t eat carbs for dinner this week and she is happy she’s no longer bloated! I INSPIRED MY MIDDLE-AGED KOREAN BUS AUNTIE!\\n\\nTHEN. Tonight, I pop into my local convenience store. The woman who works there has witnessed first hand my absolutely horrendously trash diet for years. Carbs, microwave meals, crisps, bottles of wine... I don’t go in as often anymore because I cook at home and don’t drink right now. But I needed paper towels. \\n\\nAgain, she does not speak English and I do not speak nearly enough Korean. But she asks me if I’ve lost weight!! And again, I tell her how much and that I eat Keto and she’s amazed and so kind and complimentary. \\n\\nI know I’m still obese. I stand out as a foreigner anyway, never mind being overweight. But like... my Korean neighbours are noticing and are proud of me. Despite the language barrier, they are making effort to comment! None of my Korean co-workers have commented yet. I’m curious when or if... haha. \\n\\nAlso, bonus NSV: I just want to give myself props for finally taking the time to commit to learning how to do Keto long-term in Korea. I did it! I get it now! It’s actually become intuitive for me and that feels great.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: I just cannot believe my Korean locals are commenting and complimenting me  ㅠㅠ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A little about me: I’m 5’2 and currently just returned to ONEderland. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I guess?) and hypothyroidism around at age 12. Thanks to these 2 conditions and gorgeous genes (/s)I gained weight rapidly through the years, to the point where I ended up obese by age 16/17. I have seen numerous endocrinologists and all they have to offer is birth control pills and metformin for PCOS and meds for thyroid. While thyroid pills never seemed to bug me, BCs basically took a toll on my mental health and I guess led to me gain more weight. And another excellent advice all of them gave was to reduce weight, which by the way didn’t happen even on a 1100 cal diet with 1 hour at the gym in the evenings and 3-4 km runs in the morning. Whatever little I lost, I always gained double that in less than half the duration. With all of this, I lost confidence in myself and developed tonnes of insecurities. My mom constantly reminding me that I’m fat, lazy, slow, hairy, useless etc doesn’t help either. \\n\\nIn the beginning of 2020, I tried keto as it looked like the only way I could control my PCOS symptoms. It worked decently and I lost close to 13 kgs (~ 28 lbs) in 2-2.5 months. For me, that was a lot since I never lost that much weight before. Due to the pandemic and not having enough supplies, I had to stop keto and get back to a “regular” diet. A year went by and thanks to my chronic illnesses, I gained back all 13 and 3 kgs more.\\n\\nOn 2nd of March, I was determined and started the keto again. So far, I just lost 6 kgs (~ 13 lbs) most of which must be water weight. I don’t know what’s going wrong but I can’t seem to lose weight. I also have a lot of physical fatigue. As my mom says something that triggers me, I end up not eating as much as I probably should. I consumed a total of ~850 calories yesterday. For someone my size, that’s really less. This leaves me with practically no energy to workout. I’m trying to eat more often but I just can’t seem to get hungry. I believe I’m not on ketosis. Could you suggest ways consume more fat in smaller meals or any other advice? Not being able to lose weight through the only way that works for me is so painful. I want to at least get to 70kgs (~155 lbs) by this August. Any advice would be highly appreciated! \\n\\ntl;dr : on keto for about a month now. Not losing the same amount of weight as last time. Really stressed about this. Need help to maintain ketosis (cuz I guess I’m not on it constantly)',\n",

If I can drink my bulletproof every morning as my breakfast and still do intermittent fasting without gaining any weight, then I think I’ll start eating carbs again. \\nBasically what I’m asking is, can I still drink bulletproof if I’m eating carbs. I’ll still do intermittent fasting and the bulletproof will be my only “food” until lunch time. I just don’t want to risk gaining a lot of weight, while I want more muscle, I’m overall very happy with my body right now. Anyone have advice or in a similar situation? It seems hard to find info on this. Thanks!',\n",

So, I started doing 3 pasture raised eggs, 1 sausage, and a few mushrooms for my breakfast 5-7 days a week, and eating some liver and onions on the weekend.

       "  'selftext': \"I'd like to share some exciting progress with the group here.  After a couple week self imposed plateau, I've wandered into One-derland!\\n\\nI discovered the fasting subreddit.  My first 42 hour fast broke my plateau and helped teach me to eat slowly and smaller.  I also incorporated \\\\~ 9000 steps per day at this time.  This pushed my weight from 210 - 205.  Recently, I started a journey based entirely in lunacy - I was inspired by the folks at /r/fasting to begin a 7 day fast.  I'm on day 4, although it has been a bit dirty, I've had 3 drinks over those 90 hours, but otherwise very successful!  I've ramped my walking effort up from 9000 steps to the 10k - 15k range, but I won't be sustaining that over a longer period of time.  I dropped from 205.6 at the start of the fast to 198.8 this morning.  I know much of that is water weight (which is puzzling, since I've been pretty good about being keto for 2 months), but it felt amazing to step on the scale and see a 1 in the hundreds digit!  I'm hoping that in the following 3.5 days, I can lose enough mass to stay in the 190s after breaking fast.\\n\\nI'm posting this here because... frankly, I couldn't dream of getting nearly 4 days into a fast without keto.  Given the voracious hunger, I would have broke on day 1, day 2 at best.  Overall, I've lost about 25 pounds in 2 and a half months.  My prediction for onderland was the first week of April and I seem to have beaten that mark by one day.  \\n\\nOn to the next goal, I'm shooting to lose the next 25 pounds over 3 months.\",\n",

I was using Fitness Tracker, which was fine, but the problem I had was that I would eat something that “seemed” keto and then track it, sometimes not until the end of the day or even the following morning. Even when I thought I was in good shape for the day, I often found myself in the 30-40 gm territory from sneaky carb content. \\n\\nMeal planning would help address this; but I am someone who really has a hard time eating things I’m not on the mood for. And I tend to graze out of the fridge for most of my meals; I only really cook proper meals on the weekend. Otherwise it’s just throwing together a plate of meat, cheese, and whatever else looks good. \\n\\nMy solution is to compile a spreadsheet of the keto foods I like best and eat most. I captured their net carbs per my typical serving. I categorized them by general type and in order of what I should be eating (protein, veg, seed/nut, fat, condiment, fruit). Then I sorted the contents with in each category from most to least net carbs per my typical serving. \\n\\nBecause it’s on my computer screen, it’s easy to track throughout the day, and then I can easily see what my balance of net carbs is and then look at my options by scanning the top and middle of each category when I’m running low on carbs. By keeping protein at the top, I’m channeling my snacking on that direction since I can scan the list until something looks good, starting with proteins (versus scanning my fridge and starting with cheese or hot dogs).  I’m still tracking macros and calories, this just offers a way for me to narrow my choices within the bands they should be in.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I have done keto a couple of times for weight loss now, &amp; it usually starts off fast with the weight loss &amp; then slows down a lot a few weeks in (with zero changes in diet). I’ve gotten stuck like this a few times before &amp; there was a few times in the past where I took a short few days to week long break from Ketosis. For example; most recently I took a break to partake in a small slice of birthday cake. The very next day, down a pound. Repeat, down another pound. After a few days, up to a week, this effect levels off and then the weight loss sits stagnant. So start up ketosis again &amp; the weight loss is back to normal again. Then a couple weeks later and the weight loss slows down again. I’ve noticed this phenomenon a few times now &amp; I’ve chalked it up to comparing it to the enhanced effects of circuit training exercise.. in which you have short periods of altering levels of intense exercise to reap benefits exceeding that of a regular consistent pace for the same time. So has anyone else here ever read about it experienced this effect of circuit dieting in the ketogenic diet? Seems like it works, but I’d like to see some confirmation',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'What Is It and What Makes It a Lifestyle? A ketogenic lifestyle consists of eating the ketogenic way: low carb, high healthy fat, and moderate protein 99 percent of the time - even if it’s your birthday. What does it mean to eat ketogenic, though? Well, basically you eat in such a way that your body produces ketones. Don’t worry, this is not scary; in fact, ketones can protect your brain from Alzheimer’s and other problems, such as brain fog and memory. What if you started eating the way your ancestors used to eat? What would that look like? When you consider what your ancestors did not have, namely processed food, you can see what that might look like. The food around was that which was easily available such as berries, wild animals, and vegetables that are easy to grow like spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Because it was hard to catch food, they also had to ensure everything they ate was as high in fat as possible so that they could keep on enough weight to be healthy. But not fake fat, of course - healthy fat from fruit like coconut oil and olive oil. Some people also enjoy ghee, which is clarified butter, in this plan. That’s the other thing that is awesome about the ketogenic lifestyle; you do have lots of leeway in what you eat if it follows the main goals, which are to eat low carb, high fat, and moderate protein most of the time. Processed food is full of refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemicals that no one can pronounce and will leave you unsatisfied, always craving more. And guess what; it’s not your fault if you’re always craving more. They made the food that way. The food you’re eating is designed to cause cravings. Processed food is made to hook you on it, just like opiates. The food scientists know the exact combinations of fat, salt, and sugar to hook you. They’ve found the formula to make every meal into a drug. What’s worse is that this drug will make you fat, unhealthy, prone to diabetes and you’ll likely die earlier than you otherwise would. Even when you think you’re eating small amounts of food called \"diet\" food, you can be fat and very unhealthy. In fact, thin people whoare eating a fully processed diet are also very unhealthy and prone to illness. Disease manifests differently in everyone. Thankfully, the ketogenic diet has become more mainstream. People are taking to it and getting healthier. They’re getting healthier because it’s simple. They don’t have to think too hard to know whether they can have that food or not. Due to this fact, it makes it easy for the ketogenic way of eating to become a full-on lifestyle. That’s good, because one thing that can ensure that people really change for life, and make eating keto a habit, is to turn it into a lifestyle. When you know you’re going to live this way forever, that you’re not taking breaks, and that you’re not doing it for just the next few weeks until the big party, then you tend to stick to a healthier way of eating because it’s just normal and natural. Since ketogenetic eating is so natural, you’ll agree that it can easily become a lifestyle.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Tl,dr: history of binge starve / eating disorder, trying to be healthier. Been on keto two weeks, still overeating on keto. Got metallic taste in mouth and realizing that’s a sign I’m in ketosis. Wondering if my appetite will decrease with time considering I am doing keto correctly this time.\\n\\nHey! From my other posts, I described my struggle with binge eating.. The reason why I am posting it here is because I noticed my binge eating got worse when I started “keto” months ago, and I am assuming because I kept going on and off+added many sweeteners to my diet which I cut all out. Anyways I am now doing stricter keto and am trusting the process. I want to say that these cravings are carb cravings, because I will eat and wait it out and still want to eat. But I am not certain, it could just be psychological.\\n\\nI am two weeks in. I started the first week eating 3500-5500 keto. I know it’s crazy, I don’t know how or why I have such a big appetite. It’s NOT hunger, they are cravings. My appetite has reduced a little, I have few days I eat under 1500, but it fluctuates from 2000-3500 if I’m being honest. I am drinking water, but it’s seriously getting insane. I am 170ish 5’8bfemale. \\n\\nAnyways, you know that feeling when you are hungry, but you genuinely don’t mind eating? Like you feel satisfied with very little food. I’m trying to get that. I know some people will say “maybe keto is not for you” but then again, carbs will make me go even crazier, ESPECIALLY sugar, lol. So there is no point in me not doing this, especially since I am counting carbs far more strictly. Plus carbs make me tired. At least I can over eat and not want to fall asleep after a meal hahaha. I do exersice enough to maintain my muscle but that’s about it\\n\\nSo what I wanted to ask, was should I just trust the process? These cravings are insane and I’m trying to find out if they are carb cravings or if I just need to find some help with my history of binging / starving. I used to be able to lose weight easily, but that is not the case anymore, and I’m not sure why. Because I don’t simply lose all control around food, I eat and I wait it out , and when I realize I still have cravings, that’s what adds up the calories and causes me to overeat. It’s not like I come home and just eat everything in sight. \\n\\nBut I wanted to share, today for the first time, I tasted that “metallic” taste and my pee smells weird, even water tasted weird. This didn’t stop me from overeating a lot, but it was a sign that I am in ketosis. \\n\\nSo what do you guys think? Do you think that if I wait it out these cravings will go away? Idk if 2 weeks is long enough for not.I think I kind of got excited to realize that taste in my mouth. I thought “hey, maybe this keto thing is just in the process and your insane appetite will eventually adapt” and I am eating less than the first few days, but still a lot. I can’t control these cravings lol I just need to eat.\\n\\nThank you for the help guys, I really love how supportive this subreddit is!',\n",

Around 6 years ago when I was probably around 17, I lost 40 pounds after discovering keto and it's always held a special place in my heart.  \\n\\n\\nSo I've been hardcore dieting for the last 5 months and because of the strict level of the calories I'm at, I basically have no choice but to do Keto to hit my dietary fat needs and protein goals. My first question is regarding how long I've been holding onto what feels like basically a waterbed like consistency of fat around my mid section/love handles. I'm 23, 6'4 at 180\\\\~lbs so I'm nearing the end here of my cut, but at the same time I just can't seem to drop this portion. I feel like I've had it for the last 2 months at least, but my upper abs have became more visible as well different portions of my body such as much more quad definition/minor striations. So I doubt it's the pre-whoosh effect/squishy fat. It feels nothing like the rest of the fat on my body which is why it's odd to me. In fact, it's EXTREMELY pliable. Almost reminds me of PlayDough or that magic-mud cornstarch mixture that got pretty popular for awhile.

       "  'selftext': \"Hi, \\n\\nMy husband and I have been off and on Keto for the better part of the last two years. Every time that we've been going strong something happens and we end up going off. The first time was financial reasons, and the past year I've lost my grandmother and my uncle.  It seems like every time something emotional hits it triggers my anxiety and depression disorders and I end up getting some kind of fast food that's unhealthy. We quit this time because I was having near constant panic attacks about family drama and buying our first home. The stress that came along with moving and having t handle family made my husband suggest we use food for comfort while getting through this time. It did help with the panic attacks but now I'm feeling depressed, lethargic and I just need some support. \\n\\nThe worst part is that I'm fairly certain I'm allergic to nightshades, (Things like Potatoes, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers) because I cut them out completely when on Keto, and whenever we go off Keto I get back my acid reflux, and migraines as well as acne flare-ups. \\n\\nI know that it's a mindset issue. Keto helps with my anxiety and depression disorders once I've been into ketosis for about two weeks and I'm feeling rather worthless and awful about myself. If I were good enough, we would have just stayed keto and I'd be on my weight loss journey. Instead, I'm the heaviest I've ever been, my stomach hurts all the time and I'm struggling with my daily life. My parents and siblings have never been supportive emotionally and it's hard to feel alone a lot. My husband is very supportive but whenever he's at work these lonely feelings just creep in. \\n\\nI'm not asking for any help in regards to my mindset, I really need to hear some supportive words from a community that understands my daily struggles with self-image and weight loss. We're planning on restarting Keto in a few weeks once we move into our home. \\n\\nThanks for letting me vent a little, even just typing this has helped. \\n\\nTLDR: I'd appreciate some nice words and comments to help me realize I'm not the worst person in the world for struggling with the world situation and stopping Keto for a few weeks to help my mental health.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"For a bit of background, I've always been a pretty average weight my whole life. However, once I reached my late 20s, I was diagnosed with PCOS, and also have a history of hypothyroidism. What got me to go to the doctor for PCOS was when I rapidly gained weight in a very short amount of time despite no changes in my lifestyle or diet (I was running about 20 miles a week and work a job where I'm on my feet). I was tested for insulin resistance because it's quite common with PCOS, but I did not have it. I didn't make any changes in my diet at all, but over the next year, I managed to drop all the (over 40lbs) weight caused by an eating disorder and being in an abusive relationship. \\n\\n\\nFlashback to now, I'm 31 and in the last year and a half I gained over 60lbs, and I've never felt more horrible about myself or my appearance in my entire life. My doctor suggested giving Keto a try because even after adding 5 days of HIIT to my 20 miles a week, and religiously counting calories, I still wasn't making any progress with my weight loss. \\n\\nI've been doing keto for about a month (keeping under 20g of carbs a day, but I won't throw a fit if I squeak in 30g), and the first two weeks were definitely rough, but I was happy I was seeing the scale go down for the first time in forever. My concern is that I'm not really getting hungry now. Like, I spent my entire day only being fueled by a 10 calorie electrolyte supplement and here I am at 8:30 at night trying to make myself eat and I'm STRUGGLING to want to eat. I'm not sure if it's adapting to keto that's making me lose my hunger and appetite, or if it's my former eating disorder brain taking control again. I don't see my doctor for another month, but I'd be interested to know if anyone else has dealt with a loft of appetite and if it eventually gets better? \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: No longer hungry nor do I have an appetite on keto. I struggle to eat as I have with a former eating disorder. Asking if the loss of appetite has affected anyone and if it gets better.\",\n",

Truly, I miss doing keto. For most people, it can be a challenging regime to follow; there\\'s definitely a lot of willpower, determination, and self control that goes into it, but it definitely made me proud of myself that I was following through. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMany people know that keto is under a lot of scrutiny by the media a majority of the time. I saw this with my friends as well. When I started getting into keto and had to be more conscious of what I ate, I felt judged and unsupported. The common things they would say is what a lot of people hear: \"This doesn\\'t seem sustainable at all.\" \"You\\'re not going to die if you have carbs.\" \"This isn\\'t healthy at all.\" \"You\\'re just going to end up gaining all the weight back once you finish anyway.\" I would explain the positive changes I was seeing, but it would go in one ear and out the other. Sometimes, a part of me felt like it came from jealousy. My roommates, on the other hand, had no problem with my keto diet, and frankly didn\\'t even care that I was on it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI know people will say that they\\'re not my real friends if they don\\'t support me, but I don\\'t like to fall under this line of thinking. They\\'re great friends but I feel that people are more \"supportive\" of keto after they\\'ve done it. My parents were both keto for a year and my aunt has been keto for 4 years and they were super supportive of me. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo my question is... What have been your experiences with judgment towards your regime, and how did you ignore/overcome it? What kept you motivated throughout, etc? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Note: I am a female in my 20s along with all my friends -- this can definitely play a role LOL',\n",

And while I don\\'t personally look all that much different, the scale informs me that I\\'ve dropped 16# since starting. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA few observations:   \\n\\\\-I don\\'t know if it\\'s the keto or the IF (or both) but they do something magical to my cravings. Very little (if any) junk/carb cravings \\n\\n\\\\-I haven\\'t broken my occasional need for an energy drink in the morning, but it\\'s definitely lessened. And when I need one, I reach for a Red Bull Zero or a Rockstar Total Zero. \\n\\n\\\\-Fallen in love with chicken thighs! Batch-cook them in the Instant Pot, shred them, and store them in the fridge for a cheese wrap, salad, or just heated in a bowl with Franks Red Hot! \\n\\n\\\\-There\\'s still an occasional sweet tooth calling me, and I\\'ve discovered the absolute best alternative: Atkins Peanut Butter cups. 3g net carbs and they\\'re as delicious as Reeses! \\n\\n\\\\-Cheese. Cheese, cheese, cheese. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, thank you all again, and I can\\'t wait to share another update in the future!',\n",

Whilst the diet was sustainable, I felt great, healthy, energetic etc. I did quit for 3-4 months and following the birth of my daughter and an over-indulgent Christmas break I had put pretty much all of it back on, which I thought was fair enough.\\n\\nI've tried again this year, with some success - 6.5KG and 3.2% body fat loss in the same period, but finding it harder work and less rewarding this time around - I think as the gains are slower than the previous period?\\n\\nI'm copying below the 'data points' from both periods and I'd really greatly appreciate your feedback to help me get answers to my two main questions:\\n\\n1. I've used so many different calculators it's difficult to know what kind of weight and body fat % loss I should be targeting (per week) and if my Macros are (or were) optimised. I got the feeling with attempt #1 I was potentially losing weight a little 'too quickly', but that also gave me the flexibility to have cheat days knowing it would not derail me for too long.\\n2. Should I be taking the logical approach and reverting to my previous Macros where I was getting results I was happy with? I am currently 85KG which is by no means heavy, but my body-fat is around 25% fat which I am desperate to reduce. I do very little exercise currently, due to a combination of COVID and new family life - if that makes any difference.\\n\\n**Attempt #1 (Averages)**\\n\\nFAT - 120G / 65%  \\nPROTEIN - 105G / 25%  \\nCARBS - 17G / 4%  \\nCAL - 1600  \\n\\\\- 0.7KG and 0.3% FAT loss per week\\n\\n**Attempt #2 (Averages)**\\n\\nFAT - 110G / 55%  \\nPROTEIN - 135G / 35%  \\nCARBS - 17G / 4%  \\nCAL - 1700  \\n\\\\- 0.3KG and 0.1% FAT loss per week\\n\\nThank you so much in advance!\",\n",

This time I was keeping up with my water WAY better however. This time I only dropped 4.4 pounds in the first week. Yesterday I woke up to discover I weighed a pound more than I did the morning before. I still weigh exactly that this morning. 185.8. So in these weeks I’ve essentially only dropped 2 pounds at most, since I will regain at least 5 pounds of water weight as soon as I go back to eating carbs. This diet is not going to be a lifetime change for me. I was just trying to drop some quick pounds before trying for another baby with the hubby.\\n\\nI’ve been logging my daily food intake and have stayed well within my carb goals of less than 18g a day. Often I’m ending the day with 8 or more carbs remaining. I’ve also not gone over my other macros either. And have stayed within range of all of them. I’m definitely not eating too much and I don’t snack much as I hate virtually all sugar alternative snacks. My ketones tests all come back positive everyday.\\n\\nIs this normal weight loss? Or should I just give up? Maybe Keto just cannot work for me. This is a very hard diet to stick to. I’ve no problems giving up snacks, as I’d already limited myself before I started keto, but no pasta or rice or bread is very hard. Still I could easily stick with it if it were actually doing any good but at this point I feel it’s not doing much of anything at all. Two pounds (maybe) in the first week is not worth it. I could eat healthier and force myself to actually excessive for that measly amount. Any thoughts, advice, especially from those keto veterans out there, would be great! Thanks!',\n",

I made an account specifically for this subreddit. I had stalked it for about a month before giving it a try. The current goal weight is only my first goal. I will be setting new goals after reaching those. Making realistic goals for myself first. \\n\\nThe first month I lost 16 pounds. I started at the beginning of February. I was absolutely shocked by how much better I felt within that first month. No more bloating, more mental clarity, overall I became less socially anxious and never as tired as I used to be! Not to mention the reduced appetite and overall confidence boost that it gave me determination. No more of my reckless binge eating. \\n\\nDuring March I hit a miniature stall. I lost another pound or so in the beginning of March. The scale wasn’t budging at all after that. It went on for about 3 weeks. Not enough to be called an official stall. It wasn’t until this last week that the scale started to budge again. Even though it only budged a pound it felt like a huge victory after it refusing not to budge for almost an entire month. I know, I know, the inches matter too. Although I don’t really have anything to measure inches. But during March I also noticed my endurance had increase as some of you might have seen from my recent NVS evil hill post. Even though I have only lost 4 pounds this month even the small victories add up. Who knows there is still 2 more days to go in March. But I am 4 pounds away from onederland! Been almost 2 years since I had last been in onederland.\\n\\nIf anyone needs a push to start or get back on well here it is. Small victories count and they sure do add up over time. Also on a little side note, has anyone else like when they look at high carb foods they used to love, they just don’t look as appetizing anymore? KCKO.',\n",

I have never been an over eater, dont even like fast food or junk but will over snack here and there but its never been a real problem as I never keep snacks in the house. I have always felt that I eat less than most people yet have always been heavier than most. Every attempt to lose weight has resulted in a measly 5lbs loss in 3 months or so then I lose heart and give up because the process is always painful for me, so then just go back to my old way of eating, even though my old way of eating ain\\'t bad at all.\\n\\nAnyway I started my keto journey mid Feb, weighed myself after 3 weeks of carefully logging my food intake with 20 grams of carbs. Miserable most if the time and wondering if I am just wasting my time like before and . Then I stepped on the scale and had barely lost anything, maybe 1lb, despite all the science saying its in those first few weeks that you lose rapidly, never seems to happen for me on any diet. I cried to realize I hadn\\'t lost anything despite eating keto for 3 weeks. And I am eating the right way I know, I eat enough fat and protein to not be hungry but I miss regular good so much. \\n\\nSo I will not weigh myself for a couple more months. I dont feel or look like I have lost any weight and its been 1.5 months, even fasted two whole days. Cheat days = 3.\\n\\nBut I feel so hopeless\\n1. Anyone out there who felt like their initial weight loss didn\\'t even really happen like it does for everyone else?\\n2. How do you stay the course when you feel so discouraged,  when you think despite your efforts nothing will ever work for you and you see no light at the end of the tunnel.\\n3. I have heard a lot of people say there have been on keto for years. Wondering at what point you were fully happy with the keto lifestyle, no longer miserable with what you had to eat and did not even miss carbs anymore? When will I get to this point too?\\n\\nI feel so hopeless, and kind of miserable because I miss the carbs. Everyday is a struggle even though I have kept at it for 1.5 months. I need some encouragement as I am about to throw in the towel.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hello and thanks to anyone who responds in advance. \\n\\nI have been on keto for 6 weeks and have lost 4 pounds. I've been strict and have only cheated once with half a piece of cake at my own engagement dinner.  I'm frustrated because I tried keto a few times last year and the weight would melt off me. I lost 13 pounds then 17 pounds, but gained the weight back once I abandoned the lifestyle. I thought the next time I'd try keto, I'd have no problem losing the weight but this year has been so different! I've been the strictest I've ever been on keto and i have barely lost anything. \\n\\n\\\\-Most days, I do about an hour to an hour 15 min of cardio on an empty stomach. It's not super strenuous, but I've mixed up doing walking and HIIT some days, and just walking and elliptical on others. I don't believe i'm over exercising. \\n\\n\\\\-I ordered a Keto Mojo about 3 weeks ago and my fasting glucose is in the 70-80 range. My ketone level is consistently under 1. One or two days it went up to 1.5 but I mostly stay at 0.5 to 0.8. \\n\\n\\\\-I did one meal a day for about 2 weeks, making sure my one meal was rich in good fats. I'd drink coffee, eat 3 farm fresh eggs, keto toast with 4 net grams carbs, and i would make an avocado spread. And of course, MCT oil. I reduced my cheese intake and nut intake. I do not eat keto snacks. \\n\\n\\\\-Since I haven't been losing, I've looked into whether a few of the foods (like for example, the keto bread) are causing my blood sugar to rise. I've tested this using my KetoMojo to test my BG and ketones 30 min, 1 hour, and 3 hours after I eat. No problem with the foods! None of the ones I suspected increased my blood sugar more than 25 units at 30 min, and I returned to baseline by 3 hours. \\n\\n\\\\-Yes, I get good sleep.\\n\\n\\\\-No, I don't think i'm that stressed out at all. \\n\\nAny help would be very much appreciated. Why am I not losing like before? Should I do fasting? One meal a day? I do that then read that the reason I'm not losing is because my calorie count is too low! I'm so discouraged and sad.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': ' \\n\\nDepois de dar à luz nosso filho em julho passado, eu sabia que precisava perder peso. Mas eu estava com medo. Eu havia tentado e falhado tantas vezes que simplesmente não conseguia passar pela ansiedade, impaciência, autocrítica, desespero e derrota mais uma vez. Portanto, decidi esperar até que estivesse emocionalmente pronto para perder peso. (Graças a esta submissão, eu já estava mentalmente preparado e sabia o que precisava fazer quando estivesse pronto para me comprometer.)\\n\\nPara mim, prontidão emocional significava aprender a ser grato pelo meu corpo. Tinha carregado dois bebês lindos (um que pesava 4,5 kg ao nascer) e era forte apesar de anos de estresse e alimentação estressante. Também tive que parar de ver minha dieta como um castigo por engordar e, em vez disso, começar a ver a perda de peso como um presente que eu queria dar ao meu corpo por tudo que ele fez por mim. E, finalmente, eu tive que deixar de acreditar que eu tinha que fazer Keto perfeitamente, e se eu não o fizesse, eu estava condenado ao fracasso e acabaria desistindo. De novo.\\n\\nQuando reiniciei o Keto em 9 de fevereiro, me pesei, mas não tirei nenhuma foto. Eu não rastreei minhas macros ou registrei minha comida porque rastrear essas coisas sempre me fez questionar se eu estava “otimizando” meus esforços. Eu simplesmente comia alimentos com pouco ou nenhum carboidrato (principalmente carne, queijo, ovos, manteiga) e vegetais. Tirei uma foto “antes” alguns dias depois, mas apenas de frente e de trás. E então, algumas semanas depois disso, tirei algumas fotos depois de ver alguém neste grupo dizer como isso foi útil para ela.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEmail goldboy.rj@gmail .com',\n",

Since then I've lost a total of 14 lbs (Started at 289 lbs sitting at 275 lbs) which is an ACHIEVEMENT all in itself since I'm on a corticosteroid called prednisone for my asthma. Before keto, the hubs and I used to enjoy making yogurt in our instant pot because it was cheaper for us to make our morning breakfasts than buy premade. Since we've started we've been having a hard time finding a good yogurt that is 1. tasty and 2. still keto-friendly. We found some Kroger carb master ones that are pretty good and seem to fall within the carb intake we want but I want to attempt making it ourselves again but I'm at a loss at how to make yogurt at home that's still ok! Does anyone have any experience with this? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSecond question: Every year we get a ham for Easter and usually after stuffing our faces with delicious delicious ham, we save the ham hock so my hubby can make his fantastic ham hock soup. However this year since we're on the keto train, we're not sure how to make a tasty ham hock soup with no beans in it (his recipe calls for navy beans). Anyone have any good recipes they're willing to share with some newbies? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThanks for all the help! till next time\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Keeping it simple - Huge libido increase / no PMS',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"(Long post!)\\n\\nSo a few weeks back I posted here, I was getting anxious about cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. I just kept going, mostly because it just made sense for my body (never - ever have I felt this happy before while doing a major change on my diet, and I followed most of the advice people gave me here). I am a 37 (F), mother of 2, and I still have some weight to lose. These last few weeks I switched yoga for belly dance, 3-4 days a week, kept eating fat, proteins, some vegetables (a bit of zucchini here and there, and cauliflower) and green leaves (spinach, lettuce, etc). \\n\\nSo everything's going great, but I wanted to ask some of the women here, I've read many posts about Keto worsening your PMS, but my experience was the absolute opposite. I've been eating Keto for almost a month now, and I've always suffered before my period, really bad PMS, horrible migraines, a cyst in my right ovary that sometimes caused excruciating pain (having to go to the ER on some occasions), cramps, loose stools, vomiting, joint pain and binge eating. This month was nothing like that, smooth as silk. I didn't have any cravings (though I ate cocoa nibs before and dark chocolate with no sugar), I did indulge in hot cocoa with a bit of cream and some drops of stevia (don't really use sweeteners at all, but this time I did), and on my first day I'm feeling surprisingly better than I have felt in years. A side effect though, is that a week after I started eating Keto my libido went up, high as hell, like a teenager. I've been looking for an explanation but I still can't quite get it. Is it the estrogens because of the meat I'm eating? Have I always been healthier and hornier and I just got stuck on an awful lifestyle for most of my life? \\n\\nIt feels crazy, I'm not even counting calories, I just stay Keto as naturally as I can, keeping it very simple, and I know I've lost weight (my balance is broken so idk how much I've lost), but I don't think just losing weight can make me this horny, or feeling so good about myself. Or work on my cyst and my ovaries, and PMS... It feels so amazing. 6 months ago my then boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore, I don't even know what I was thinking being with him, it was the worse relationship of my life, and as I look back now I feel so different from that overweight, overtired and turned off woman that I was then... \\n\\nI'm just so amazed by this return to health, so to speak... I've been approached by other men, I feel is something that it is also starting to show in the outside, so it's not just a feeling apparently. I had sex with a guy I used to date, but my libido still can't get enough (what's wrong with me? 🤣). I can't say that I'm feeling like running a marathon now that I'm on my period, it still hurts a bit, and I still use a warm bottle, but I'm not crying in pain or feeling indisposed. Still feel horny though, that makes me really curious. \\n\\nSo, have any of you girls / women have noticed this kind of hormonal changes? \\n\\nTLDR: Almost a month of Keto, PMS went away, libido is high as hell. Want to know if someone has gone through a similar situation\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'After giving birth to our son last July, I knew I needed to lose weight. But I was afraid to. I had tried and failed so many times, I simply did not have it in me to go through the anxiety, impatience, self-criticism, hopelessness, and defeat once again. So I decided I would wait until I was emotionally ready to lose weight. (Thanks to this sub, I was already mentally prepared and knew what I needed to do once I was ready to commit.)\\n\\nFor me, emotional readiness meant learning to be grateful for my body. It had carried two beautiful babies (one who weighed 10.13 lbs at birth), and was strong despite years of stress and stress eating. I also had to stop seeing my diet as a punishment for getting fat and instead start seeing weight loss as a gift that I wanted to give my body for everything it has done for me. And finally, I had to let go of the belief that I had to do Keto perfectly, and that if I didn’t, I was doomed to failure and would just wind up quitting. Again. \\n\\nWhen I restarted Keto on February 9, I weighed myself but I did not take any pictures. I did not track my macros or log my food because tracking these things has always caused me to question whether I was “optimizing” my efforts. I simply ate low carb to no carb food (mostly meat, cheese, eggs, butter) and veggies. I took a “before” picture a few days later, but only from the front and back. And then a few weeks after that, I took some side pictures after seeing someone in this group say how helpful it was to her. \\n\\nI am now 7 weeks in. I still don’t track anything, although I weigh myself every few days because the numbers no longer cause analysis paralysis. I’ve lost 20 pounds and still have another 40 pounds to go before I will be at a comfortable, healthy BMI. I would like to try IF at some point, but I’m letting myself settle into this new normal for a little while longer. \\n\\nAnd even though the judgmental voice inside my head is telling me not to post this, I let fear and shame tell me how to feel about my body for decades. Also, I have learned so much from this sub and have been inspired by so many people here, I thought I would share my story for anyone else who may be afraid to try again. \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KOFIvZo',\n",

You can see my last post here: \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m0enfy/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_eat_keto_with_a_non/\\n\\nI knew I desperately needed to lost weight, but didn’t realize how much until I took progress pics and saw the amount of back fat I have. \\n\\nI decided to do keto the week my siblings would not be with me to have a head start. It was difficult at first, but I eventually got the hang of things. I should add that this is not my first round of keto. I tried it a couple years ago and I did lose weight but I didn’t stick with it.\\n\\nA true test of this diet would come this past Monday when my siblings came to stay with me for the week. The food that we usually eat is filled with carbs from rice sugar, bread, etc. we mainly eat Caribbean foods which are filled with carbs.\\n\\nI am writing this to encourage anyone in A situation like mine. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EAT KETO AND COOK FOR YOUR FAMILY AT THE SAME TIME. Yeah, it takes more work, but it’s worth it. You also have to be creative. \\n\\nHere’s what a couple meals this week looked like: \\n\\nMonday: Jerk Salmon, Asparagus, and baked potato (ditch the potato) \\n\\nWednesday: Chicken Kabobs, yogurt sauce, broccoli, and yellow rice (replace yellow rice with yellow califlower rice) \\n\\nFriday: Chipotle \\n\\nSaturday: Homemade Burgers, fries, ice cream, chips (no bun burger, ditch the fries, rebel ice cream, and Quest chips) \\n\\nSunday: Red beans and rice, stew chicken, baked Mac and cheese, carrot cake (okay so I didn’t have ANY of this. Can’t even have stew chicken because the base of it is caramelized sugar. I had a protein shake instead. I was planning to have a Cobb salad but got too sidetracked to prepare it. ) \\n\\nOn Sunday for breakfast I had bacon and eggs in a low carb tortilla and coffee which kept me full the WHOLE day and I only had a protein shake at 1 am before I went to sleep because I was feeling peckish. It’s unbelievable how full this diet keeps you. \\n\\nSide note: does anyone know of a sugar alcohol that caramelizes the same as sugar?? \\n\\nGUYS!!!!! I didn’t not cheat. NOT ONCE. Not with the rice, bread, carrot cake, ice cream, Doritos, aloo (potato) pie, pancakes, English muffins, Mac and cheese. And this is coming from someone with binge eating disorder. \\n\\nI wanted piece of carrot cake so bad (I like to bake) but I stayed strong. I saw some carrot cake fat bombs I’d like to try, tho. \\n\\nAnyway, sorry for the long post. Just wanted to share my experience with someone in the same boat as me. Maybe I’ll make more update posts in the future with pictures, measurements, and benefits.',\n",

I thought the same too. We were keeping it under 20 carbs everyday, so what was wrong? Then I tried something that I was avoiding. I started loosing weight immediately.\\n\\nWere you still eating your greens? \\n\\nI found out that for me personally, it wasn\\'t so much of the \"rebel ice-cream and general keto stuff everyday\" that was messing up my progress, I learned that as soon as I added green veggies into my diet everyday, I started losing weight again. Immediately. But I still eat the ice-cream, atkins, and everything keto related like that. I do this pretty much everyday. Like, now I eat 2-3 small bags of those quest chips (4 net carbs each (I know, but they are SO good)), two peanut butter cups (2 net carbs), two cheesy hot dogs wrapped in keto bread or one split keto tortilla (2 for bread or 5 carbs for tortilla), and a full can of green beans with butter and salt and pepper (I dont generally count these carbs, especially if I\\'m under 20 by that point). I lose a .8 to a pound every 2 days. I\\'ll also switch the deserts out with whatever I have at the time, like pecan ice-cream (ugh, yes)\\n\\nI now keep my carbs pretty loose. If I go over 20, its usually just 23, and the rest is filled with the green beans (7).\\n\\nIdk if this will work for everyone (because you might already be incorporating greens everyday, and there might be another seemingly inexplicable reason why your stalling)- but I do hope that this will reach another me out there who thinks that eating meat and cheese and everything else just to avoid greens is the move- because it isn\\'t.

I use olive oil/coconut oil to cook everything so I know I'm getting more with that but don't know how much to calculate I'm actually eating, some gets burnt off while cooking and when I portion out my food and refrigerate then eat the meals it's not like the oils are always distributed well or even all eaten. I would just add stuff like cheese and Greek yogurt etc to finish off my macros but I want to figure out the oils number first to try and make sure I'm still at my defecit. Am I just overthinking this or are there some rules people have that could help?\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Time to get my life in order',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'Hey everyone,\\n\\nI\\'m M46, having struggled for the vast majority of my life with my weight, going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20s, yo yo-ing up and down, stabilizing at about \\\\~275 for a few years until I decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band. That helped me out for a while, bringing my weight down to about 225, but I was building a ton of muscle at that point, going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength. And then, of course, \"life got in the way\". I work in tech, which meant long hours, grabbing whatever I could eat, and things crept up.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, I\\'ve also been suffering from mild clinical depression. Nothing crazy, but enough to add to the \"uggggggghh\" aspect of life and exercise, and coming up with excuses not to do X, Y, or Z. Unsurprisingly, things were a lot better during my \"healthy\" period, and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better. Easier said than done, especially when living in my head!\\n\\nThe challenge for me has been trust, and accountability. I\\'m married, with 2 kids, and am the cook of the house. My wife has known me forever (40+ years), and has seen me through all of my phases. I love her to death, and I know she means well, but she can be very judgmental, and over the years, I\\'ve lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health, or weight. I just get incredibly defensive, and change the subject.\\n\\nI\\'ve also tried, and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight. A few years back, I got into golfing (after years of making fun of my parents), and started WW at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks. But I would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family, or even mentioning I was doing it. Given I\\'m the cook in the house, it didn\\'t lead to good, sustaining results. This accountability problem didn\\'t just lie with how I interacted with my family, heck, my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups, and given my family has a long history of diabetes, and some heart disease, it was incredibly irresponsible. I\\'m a walking heart attack waiting to happen. I\\'d always push my reminders out a few months until \"I\\'d lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment.\".\\n\\nA few months back, I realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise I was getting at work, and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair, a few hours with the family, and then a few hours watching TV or back to work. My sleeping patterns were messed up because I\\'d choose to fall asleep on the couch, setting my alarm for \\\\~5am to then go up to bed, so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her (no sleep apnea, but boy, I can be a trumpet). My back is shot, I can barely walk straight, and am in constant pain. I\\'m an 80 year old man in a 40something body. The thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to \"normal\" is both exciting, but also agonizing. No more excuses to do absolutely nothing.\\n\\nWhile my depression has always been fairly mild, I\\'ve lost family members to suicide, and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends. But hey, if I died from a heart attack, would that be so bad? I felt like I hit rock bottom. \\n\\nI know it sounds dumb, but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time, I was seeking help, and that while I knew she meant well, I needed her to give me some room here. I\\'d tried keto a few times for short periods of time, and it suits me well in general as I\\'m not really a carbs person anyhow (but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult...). I decided to bite the bullet, and sign up to Virta Health, buy a peloton, and say screw it - I\\'ll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while, but I know I\\'ll be better. Two things that work with me: accountability and gamification. Virta holds me accountable. No hiding, the coach is on you daily, everything\\'s measured. It forced me to go to the dr and get results (and I\\'m just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken, my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high, but below any problematic numbers... Peloton, once I get started, gamifies things. I started on Duolingo learning Japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it, and not only kept going regardless of what was going on, but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to Japan. All that because of that damn streak :)\\n\\nI know all of this is irrelevant to all of you, but honestly, /r/keto has been an inspiration for the last few years, and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started. This is just the beginning, but I wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that I\\'m sure I\\'ll fall off of, but get back on again. I owe it to myself, and my amazing family.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all for making it this far.',\n",

I had had problems having healthcare prior to now, and was able to get it in January, after not having it for a long time, but I suspected that was the case for some time now.\\n\\nAfter 5 weeks, I went back for a follow-up.  My A1C1 is down 2 entire points in only 5 weeks, with keto (15 lbs weight loss) and metformin.  It's almost at normal range, and is *currently* normal, based on my blood glucose tests.  The A1C1 will assuredly go down some more in a couple months after the metformin and keto have been doing their stuff in synergy.  My doctor was impressed.  I have never seen a doctor be so perky and delighted!  He told me to keep up the good work, and complimented me three or four times.  I wasn't even sure how to take that much praise lol.  He also said he thought I could reverse my diabetes, get off of the metformin, and should strive for that.  Lucky break there, getting the doctor who knows this is possible, and doesn't just treat it like it's a done deal!\\n\\nI hope this story, however simple, helps other people see how good this way of eating can be.  I know the doctor is right, and I'm going to keep on fighting for my life and *quality* of life.  I knew diabetes was bad, but I didn't know some of the things the doctor informed me about.  It's REALLY easy to realize now, that a lot of my health nags are from the diabetes.  I can do this and so can all of you.  If anyone needs a support buddy, I'm open to that.  I could probably use a few people to talk to, too.  Will happily trade non-reddit messengers.  Good luck and good day, everyone!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey keto heroes, just wondering if anyone lives in Japan and doing Keto at the same time. I have been doing Keto for a few months and finding it's challenging to buy any food from a restaurant as keto-friendly. The Japanese people crazily into sugar. Everything, almost everything, adds a lot of sugar. Even some foods are labeled “low card,” they still contain 10-20g net carbs in a small serve. The only way to do this for me is to cook at home every day. When I go to work, I have to bring my food. But somehow im getting used to it. It's also not that good once your friends call you to dine out, but still, people around you are getting used to the fact that you are a picky mouth. 😂 So, good to live in Japan to have some excellent quality wagyu beef and all kinds of fresh fatty fish, but a low carb diet still has a long way to go here.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi all. After an emotionally draining week of family drama and funeral events...its hitting me hard. I haven’t fell off my diet or really felt like cheating...but mentally I’m running low. Self-esteem and motivation are in the gutter and I’m feeling super self-critical. Hormones are a trip. I decided to make a list of NSV’s to stay positive and keep this this keto train going. \\n\\n1. Out of all the causes of stress earlier this week, getting dressed was NOT one of them! Getting dressed up fancier than normal is usually dreadful and just uncomfortable, especially if I’m wearing a dress. This time...it wasn’t even a thought. Everything just fit and fit well. Brought the stress level down a ton. \\n\\n2. M/L size stockings no longer make me feel like suffocating. They don’t make me look like a stuffed sausage or leave a horrible red itchy mark on my stomach for hours after taking them off. Tbh, this may have been because I could never admit my size😅. They seem to be not catching runs either because of the lesser amount of stretch. Woo! \\n\\n3. Regular width flats no longer give me sharp pains on my feet. I never wear certain shoes because I have bad feet/bunions. Particular styles (like flats) I have to go for the wide choice and even then I never buy them. Holy moly! I’m still the same size 8 but now I can wear this regular width shoe with little problem?? I bought these sleek, kind of narrow looking flats. Who am I? My feet shrank! \\n\\n4. I’m no longer sweating (even with a mask) when I do a simple task like going to take the dogs out and chatting with neighbors. This one really bothered me before and it was soo awkward. Something about the mix of being overweight, overheating, and being self conscious would make me sweat (my face in particular) as soon as I leave my home or have to converse with someone. I would literally cut conversation short to run off. If it’s a makeup day, double whammy. I used to chalk this up to anxiety. Welp, no. I was just fat. Now I’m easy breezy lemon squeezey! Hell, I even get cold sometimes. \\n\\n5. I’m finding it much easier to track my monthly cycle and symptoms on keto. When I ate all the carbs and whatever I wanted, it was always so difficult to know where pain, inflammation, stomach aches, etc was coming from. Bloated and feel like shit, well is it the whole pizza I ate last night or is ovulation early? Short tempered with a headache, is it the crash from the sugary danishes or is shark week coming? These questions are so simplified for me now because my diet is on point and I know how keto makes me feel, so it’s easier to track outside symptoms. As a woman, this makes me feel really good knowing my body. \\n\\nWhen you’re feeling low and life is kicking you in the behind...remember you’re making changes and doing the damn thing. 5 pounds or 50. It doesn’t matter. Every small victory counts. Please comment if you can think of any or just want to get something off your chest 😊🙏🏼. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, girls and boys. 21 lbs down and 19 lbs to go. KCKO! \\n\\nTL;DR: Getting dressed for events is easy. Stockings don’t make me feel like dying. My feet are smaller. I don’t sweat as much. I can track my feminine cycle and symptoms better.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hey all! Here really struggling and needing some encouragement. Maybe a keto buddy? I’m 34F, 5’7”, CW 202, GW 170, mom of 3 (9 yr, 5 yr &amp; 9 mo) with a husband working nights and away or sleeping most of the of the time. (I added the kids and husband to give you an idea of my daily life...not a single mom but it can feel like I am) Successfully did keto almost 2 years ago, lost 30 lbs, felt amazing. Got pregnant with the 3rd (yay!) but gained it all back and then some. I now work from home which has its pros and cons. I am having a *really* hard time going back to keto and sticking with it. A few reasons: 1) I’m so damn tired most of the time, struggling with off and on sleep issues with the baby 2) in a food rut? Nothing sounds good, ever so I tend to just eat easy crap 3) my husband’s off days are triggers cause he will go to the store and buy food that’s tempting/we finally all get to be together and relax which also leads to more relaxed eating 4) I’m an emotional eater so if I get an emotional trigger, it’s SO hard to fight 5) meal planning for my family and then myself separately is exhausting, I despise it, so I usually count myself out and just get what the rest of the family needs (I’m aware that I need to take care of myself but it doubles my “work” in preparing for the week so I just short change my own stuff)\\n\\nWe just invested in a home gym setup so I now get to do strength training when I can fit it in which is usually my lunch breaks. Having the flexibility to work it into my schedule is amazing. I know keto is the best option for my way of eating. I honestly think I have a carb intolerance, even incorporating a little here and there works against me. I have literally been fighting between 203-200 lbs for months and months. The lowest I’ve gotten is 197 and that lasted a day. Vacillating between these 3 lbs is making me inSANE and just want to sCrEaM. I already have my food logged for tomorrow, ready to start and having a plan helps, of course. \\n\\nAnd if I’m being honest, this not being *new* is working against me. The first time I did keto it was NEW and exciting and it was awesome. Now it’s like, oh ok, I know what I need to do but it’s not *exciting*. Does that make sense at all?? I would love to hear from anyone and everyone. I know how important this community was to me the first time around and I need to stay plugged in. Thanks in advance if you made it all the way through this post AND choose to respond!!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Has anyone here had a problem with keto and thyroid? I have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. For over 20 years now. It’s been very stable for the last 10. I’ve lost 30+ pounds on keto. Lately tho, I was getting really hungry, and losing my control. Also struggling with horrible insomnia, which made me of course, completely exhausted during the day. I was thinking it was perimenopause symptoms. \\n\\nThen my hands started shaking. I knew right away. Went and got lab work done, and sure enough I’m hyper. That means I’m getting too much thyroid hormone. This can cause insomnia, heart racing, hand shaking, increased appetite....lots of fun things...sometimes it takes me a hot minute to figure out that it is a thyroid hormone fluctuation. Especially now, because it’s been so stable for so long. \\n\\nOnce before I lost weight, 100 pounds, on WW, and my levels went up. A lot! Which seems counter intuitive. You would think, lost weight, lower blood volume, you would need LESS hormone. Nope, needed more. 🤷\\u200d♀️ but sometimes this stupid disease is annoying like that. But this time I wonder about the GF aspect of this diet. I had a friend who was diagnosed, went GF, and never had to go on meds. Citing the inflammatory nature of gluten. Hence my curiosity of could the GF aspect of keto be affecting the function of my thyroid. I can get an adjustment of medication, and The insomnia and other symptoms will dissipate, I know this, but I’m curious if anyone else on here has experienced this? Have thyroid disease, done keto, and had it affect you? Not eating gluten has been really good for me in so many ways, I really don’t want to go back to it.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Sex: Female \\nAge: 25\\nHeight: 5ft 9\"\\nSW: 204 lbs | CW: 190 lbs | GW: 150 lbs\\nOld Macros: 16g Carb | 105g Fat | 85g Protein | 1357 kcal\\nNew Macros: 23g Carb | 68g Fat | 100g Protein | 1102 kcal\\nIntermittent Fasting: 16/8 (First meal at 11.30am, snack at 4pm, second meal at 7pm)\\n\\nHi everyone, I\\'m just 5 weeks into my keto journey, and swapped to my new macros just a few days ago so hopefully the weightloss improves - I\\'m still very happy with 14lbs though! I\\'m taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week, and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target. \\n\\nBut weightloss aside, I wanted to share how keto has positively affected me, to try and encourage others to stick it out, even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride. \\n\\nJoint pain - As a young person, experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating. Before lockdown I went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week, but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside. I was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but I\\'d have to go in for further tests to confirm this. Since swapping to keto, my finger pain has disappeared entirely, and my knee pain is barely there. I really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation.\\n\\nSpots / acne - In that same vein, the skin on my face has never been better. Whilst I only had mild acne on my cheeks, the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy, uneven, and red in places. The redness and spots have gone, and I cannot believe that the uneven texture I had, especially in places like my forehead where it\\'s impossible to miss, has disappeared. \\n\\nFat and water deposits - The first major change I experienced when I lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs. I use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance; not quite cellulite, but lumpy all the same. The skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone. I wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat?  \\n\\nBloating - Before keto I was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1) the food I was eating, and 2) a bad habit I had of swallowing air when I was hungry. Despite still drinking the likes of Coke Zero, I haven\\'t experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto, and my better, more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit. \\n\\nEnergy levels - I use to suffer from the post lunch slump and, as I\\'m currently working from home, would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work. When I was working in the office, this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and I\\'d be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work. Happy to say that I\\'ve shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto. I\\'m able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout. \\n\\nBrain fog - Likewise, my brain fog has gone. I struggled focussing on tasks, and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data (I create simulations for the oil and gas industry, so handle a lot of numbers). I feel like my mind is sharper now and I\\'m less likely to have my eyes \"glaze\" over. \\n\\nMood - I suffer from stress and anxiety. Whether it\\'s just down to making a positive impact in my life, or whether it\\'s the diet itself, I can\\'t remember the last time I felt this good. I feel happy, optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me, even before the phsyical weight has gone. For the first time in 7 years, I\\'m starting to feel like I\\'m getting myself back. \\n\\nSleep - No more struggling to sleep. I\\'m getting a good, undisturbed night of sleep each night, and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times, to waking up before my alarm. \\n\\nRelationship with food - I hated food. I was a high carb snack eater because I hated preparing meals. Now I actually enjoy the process of researching what I\\'m going to make, getting creative with recipes, and then getting hands on with making it. Keto\\'s restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food, and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes. \\n\\nHopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others, so thanks for letting me share ☺️',\n",
