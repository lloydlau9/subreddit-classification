vegan,mvvguj,Tytheboss16,"“If people still eat meat, they might as well get it from the right place” argument?","So I’ve got a friend who runs a small-scale (about 30 head), local, organic cattle operation.  While the cows are still being raised for beef, they’re kept on grass their whole lives, never eat grain, calves are with mothers until going to butcher, and the animals are treated with (IMO) as much respect as possible, given the circumstances.  My friend also uses a FDA/Organic (idk all the govt. terminology) approved butcher.  Apparently, the butcher uses reduced-stress means of killing.  My friend’s view on his role in society is this: if people still consume meat (and will do so for the foreseeable future), then they might as well get it from a good source (whatever the definition of “good” is).  What are y’all’s opinions/thoughts on this ideology?  

Note: I’m not trying to force an argument/opinions on anyone, just thing to start a conversation.  Also, if this question has already been posed, I apologize.",592659,1619058909,2021-04-22 10:35:09,4217,0,1

(im on a strict no alcohol medication) Anyway I see shrimp and anchovy sauce listed as ingredients!!!! What the F***!!!!! Ive been throwing up my dinner for over 30 minutes now because I cant get the thought of dead baby shrimp and anchovy’s in my body out of my head. How is this even allowed!!!!!!

I already consume a bit of those powders, but an excess may cause a huge deficit of multiple nutrients and, ofc, I wanna avoid that. I wanna go vegan without dying in the process.

**Age:** 28 y/o

**Weight:** 240 lbs.(freedom units) (108.862 kg) 

**Height:** 6 foot 2 (187.96 cm)

**Blood Pressure:** 130/80 on avg. 

**Pre Existing** **Health Issues:** Severe constipation caused by medication that is more manageable now with a veggie. diet + prune juice, Breathing issues lingering from COVID, Joint Issues.

**Issues from my new Diet that I want to negate or improve:** 

Fatigue, Focus issues, Motivation issues.

**Current Diet:** 

morning:

smoothie (spinach, bananas, strawberries, peaches, raspberries, blueberries, pomegranate, chia seeds, flaxseeds and about 8 oz. of prune juice mixed with orange juice. ) + coffee. 

lunch:

 salad bowl w/ spinach, tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, avocado, cucumber.

afternoon: 

Acai Bowl w/ bananas, chia seeds, bee pollen, strawberries, blueberries and oats

Oatmeal w/ rice milk.

Sometimes I slip and get a grilled cheese or eat mozzarella sticks so this is the one non-vegan thing  I do so I consider myself a vegetarian in transition to vegan. 

**About me:**   
I became vegetarian in January of this year (so a couple of months ago) after binge watching a couple of videos on youtube by CosmicSkeptic on cognitive dissonance and the moral reasons for veganism.  I made the decision right there to at least go vegetarian with vegan being the ultimate goal. I haven\`t completely cut out eating cheese yet. I eat it when I start to feel really low on energy but I don\`t like doing this. Cheese is the last thing holding me back from being purely vegan as far as diet goes.  This is also partially a compromise with others who insist on cooking for me but constantly ask things like well fish is okay right? How about chicken? That\`s not red meat at least? Ect.. 

I immediately recognized some benefits in my health that I didn\`t anticipate that I want to hold on to. I had an immediate reduction of chronic constipation and I also realized that my breathing cleared up as it has been really bad ever since I caught the COVID last summer. Cutting out milk really helped the breathing especially I think. I also have arthritis diagnosed and some joint issues, that have been helped by changing to this diet which I think reduced inflammation in my body.

 Because I am trying to negate the constipation, I have a small set of meals that I eat listed above. I am having some energy and motivation and focus issues (partially lingering from COVID but also from my new diet). I think this is not a very balanced diet and I would like to know any of your opinions on things I should add/subtract to give me more energy and improve my focus and motivation as I think I\`m lacking in some things. I take vitamin b-12 supplements here and there, but a vegan specific multivitamin would be helpful I think. I just don\`t know what would be a good one and couldn't find any at CVS.  I bought some vegan cookbooks but still don\`t really know which meals I need to make to be more balanced.

# TLDR: Plz Help me to vegan better. I`m scared of getting constipated more so I don`t give myself enough variety in my meals and I get tired and unmotivated.",592549,1619035826,2021-04-22 04:10:26,27300,9,1

vegan,mvnh77,FourObviousReason,My vegan journey through the pet industry &amp; more,"TW: Animal abuse. TL;DR

&gt;!Grew up in the pet industry, always 'loved animals', went to college and studied environmental conservation, realized that the pet industry is shit, all the while flirting with veganism, until poor health led me into veganism, the vegan diet improved my health, further engagement with philosophy/ethics and exposure to animal suffering drove the point home to where I am now permanently stuck as a vegan and really annoying about it.!&lt;

The truth is inevitable and will keep coming back regardless how hard you try to suppress it.

I grew up in what is widely considered a very ""animal loving"" household. My parents were involved in the pet industry, eventually owning their own business, and that's where I worked before I was even a teenager. As a result, my entire childhood was defined by being surrounded by and appreciating animals, from dogs and cats to caiman, parrots, and stingrays and everything in between. 

But there was always something a little odd about things. Being a child and being surrounded by the casualties of the pet industry, the dead fish, the feeder mice and rats, it never sat as well with me as it did for other people in my family. There was always the sense of dread and the dissonance when entering the room full of 'feeders' -- the contrast between the cuteness of the baby rats, the 'pinkies,' and what was to become of them. 

Some people prefer buying frozen feeder rodents, and when we were out of them, someone had to make more by killing them and freezing them. This was a task that was always something I refused to do, but my sibling was almost eager to do so and saw it as no big deal. So he'd take the babies and whack them against the side of a table until they were dead and then freeze them. It always made me shudder.

Being a huge computer nerd as well, I also ran the company website and was uniquely exposed to these emails we would get from animal rights activists threatening us over the treatment of certain animals. They sort of piqued my interest because I was not expecting this reaction. To me and my family, we were always very ethical in how we approached the pet industry, we thought. We took extra care to not sell animals to questionable people. No rabbits during Easter. We didn't even sell low quality dog and cat food. We educated customers on how to be responsible pet owners. If someone didn't seem responsible, we reserved the right to refuse to sell to them, and we did that more often than you might expect. 

Occasionally as a teenager I would go through these efforts to cook vegan meals sometimes. My mom would help me, being a mom, but not particularly interested in the food itself. Nevertheless, eating less meat just seemed like a thing I'd do occasionally. The truth of not harming animals seemed apparent to me but didn't really culminate into veganism until much later. Eating meat was just something everyone did without questioning it, and giving that up seemed essentially impossible.

Eventually I grew up and went off to college, and partly because I'd always been interested in animals, I decided to study environmental conservation. And it was through these college courses that, for the first time in my life, I was really faced with the totality of the negative consequences of the pet industry on the environment. It did not take much to break me away from the illusion that my parent's pet business was something that was good for animals. It was clearly not. I'd think back to my time in Florida, my parents selling exotic snakes to strangers, and fast forward to the present moment when Florida is overran with non-native snakes. I'd think of all the exotic animals and wonder where we were actually getting them from, if they were truly captively bred, and to what extent any of these sources were truly reliable. There were no good answers there.

One of my favorite subjects in college was animal behavior. I loved learning about the interesting ways that animals are more intelligent and more capable than humans have previously gave them credit for. I'd inform my brother of this stuff, but he'd always mock the notions of non-human animals being intelligent or worthy of consideration. Meanwhile, my brother being grown now as well, had developed a hot head, a quick temper, and would routinely get into violent clashes with people. As I sit back and reflect on all of it, I wonder to what extent I could have seen that coming given his attitude towards animals as a child, and I wonder to what extent the need to kill animals contributed to that mindset or if it was something that was just always a part of him.

So now I've been a college graduate for a while. I've always basically accepted vegan ethics but made various rationalizations or excuses for continuing to consume animal products. It just didn't seem like a thing that was possible to give up... until I decided to actually try it. I finally became an adult, completely financially independent, and decided to challenge myself to be vegan for 30 days. Just 30 days, I told myself, and I'd see if it was possible, and then I could go back to eating the foods that I grew up enjoying.

The 30 days went by fast, and I was surprised at how easy everything was. I didn't even miss meat that much, really. I especially didn't miss milk in the slightest. I missed cheese more than anything, but it wasn't that big of a deal. The 30 days turned into like 50 days before I decided to end the challenge.

After that point, I had went travelling all over the United States for a couple years. Living life always on the move meant not being able to prepare food for myself, and so I became reliant on other people cooking for me, on junk food, etc. It was easy to slide back into old ways of consumption. 

Then COVID came, and I took that as an excuse to not exercise as much. Eventually it struck me, and I recovered, but it seemed to fuck with my gastrointestinal system or at least trigger something that was coming soon anyway. My health was deteriorating. The way that I felt after eating was markedly worse. This GI problem lingered for the better part of a year. And with all that time being spent cooped up in the house due to COVID, I started to become interested in ethics and philosophy and began exposing myself to some nuanced arguments in favor of veganism.

Eventually I saw a doctor, and we decided to try some supplements and change some things. I voluntarily said that I had been experimenting with a vegan diet in the past and would try that again.  We opted for this lifestyle change first instead of prescription drugs. 

I immediately saw improvement with the way my body was reacting after switching to a vegan diet. Previously, when I would eat an omni diet, everything would feel so heavy, and I could just feel my gut struggling after meals (even before COVID), but this pretty much doesn't happen to me on my vegan diet.

But just exposing myself to the vegan community, to vegan ethics -- exposing myself to the realities of the animal industry -- that's what really finally drove the point home for me. I used to always shut off those vegoon propaganda videos that show me animals being tortured. ""I don't need to see this. I already understand that it is wrong. What's the point? Just to make myself feel bad?"" No, I needed to sit down, watch it, to absorb it, to allow myself to fully realize what's going on and how bad it is, to stop alienating myself from animals and their suffering.

There was some lingering rationalizations, some apologism. I'd argue some nuanced points to ethicists to try to ground my perspectives and allow them to correct me, which they did more often than not.

Now I'm at a point where I understand the gravity of the situation, how mistreated animals are, how I need to avoid products of their abuse beyond just diet, and I understand the philosophical/ethical arguments. I really think there's no going back from here.

And now my parents are entering retirement, their final years. They're not in good health. My veganism creates incredible defensive reaction and cognitive dissonance in them. I've previously mentioned to them the ways that the pet industry harms the environment. They don't really engage with it too much. I think they know, deep down, and they don't want me to tell them. And I don't want the final years with them to be me telling them their whole life has been a sort of mistake or a lie. They do genuinely like animals, they're just so wrapped up in 'the way things have always been.' I don't have it in me to preach to them.",592542,1619033607,2021-04-22 03:33:27,29519,2,1

I also really like avocados, which they say only fruit due to having bees shipped in to pollenate the crops. I haven't seen substantial evidence of this and would really like to know more. Are there other crops that are only grown with the exploitation of bugs/bees? Should I stop eating avocados?

And now that I'm thinking about all of this, couldn't it be said that all crops grown exploit animals because they take away land from them? As the land is worked for crops I'm sure there's countless bug life loss O.o

Thankfully neither of my family or friends are reliant on food banks or have any other reason they cannot be vegan, but none of them are. They truly cannot grasp why they should be vegan, no matter how many documentaries they watch, facts they learn its like they don’t care. Recently some watched the new short film about animal testing and they told me they cried, i told them i’d help them look for cruelty free makeup, but when i explained how if they’re this upset by animal abuse i’d love to help them transition to veganism they completely switched off and didn’t care at all. They act like i’m extreme and crazy for not killing animals and it makes feel crazy.

I went vegan at the start of lockdown, didn’t have to deal with judgment of others, now we’re out with people again i’m constantly having to justify and prove my veganism like what i’m doing insane, its so stressful.

I just wanted to make a post here to see if there are others who sometimes feel this way. Sometimes when I'm going about my day, I suddenly get pictures in my head of animals being abused, and I instantly imagine my kitten in their place and the innocence they have and the pain, confusion, the loneliness they must be feeling. And I find myself so hopeless when I think that humans are outside, living freely and having our rights fought for, our wellness evaluated while we impose so much pain on animals. And it just makes me wonder why we're living this way, and how we can live this way so normally. We're alright, but we subject living beings to unimaginable pain. I hate that the world is like this and I hate that a majority of the population is not aware. It makes living feel so pointless if there are so many living things being hurt right at this moment.

vegan,mvhqem,SkeeterYosh,"I’ve asked my parents if they want to go vegan, but both of them have no drive to despite me trying to lead by positive example. I think I now know why. See if you can give any advice based on this story!","Now I’m not vegan yet (freegan best describes myself at the moment, and I may stay that way for a while as it appears more morally and environmentally friendly than veganism, and I’m not living independently yet), but I’m working my way to it; who would’ve thought it required so much inside knowledge of each and every product I use regularly?!

That aside, while neither of my parents (especially my father) have the drive to go vegan (and they even watched Dominion), which has kinda annoyed me as I’m currently around them 24/7, I think I know why this is.

During an excursion to Oklahoma to see the estate my late grandmother left behind to us via inheritance, I got to experience lower-class country life firsthand in the town of Okmulgee. Many of the citizens didn’t wear masks around other people (Oklahoma had a mask lift ala Texas) and were highly religiously devoted, horses were tamed via machine, and animal agriculture was prevalent. One of my dad’s first cousins had to move here from California due to COVID restrictions giving him far more trouble finding a job, and I felt bad for his situation and other citizens’. It was the first time I genuinely found myself empathizing with poor people. Another one of his cousins led us to another one of the left-behind estates, which included a small open field with two horses, one of which was rideable. He then told me he was going to bring one of them to be bred for another riding horse (I was pretty disgusted by that, but didn’t tell it to his face). That aside, while my dad didn’t live here, it was where his grandmother lived, and he visited this place relatively often as a child (he was born in 1967). He is a hardcore meat-eater (especially beef and pork), though he’s allergic to fish. He also barbecues a lot.

Remember [these](https://old.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mu3oqz/very_little_is_known_from_my_perspective_but_its/) [pictures](https://old.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mu5zb9/yet_another_experience_around_an_area_associated/) I posted two days ago? Both of these come from the aforementioned town, which I now dub a MAGA hicktown (there was even a MAGA Trump billboard while my family was on the road).

As for my mother, I don’t know enough about her background to make an informed hypothesis, though I do know that she is aware of how cruel and how much of a disastrous environmental hazard factory farming, and she was speaking of wanting to give up red meat, as she knows of how bad it is for one’s health (though she’s evidently done a pretty poor job of it). She also told me she could be willing to go vegetarian, but she considers veganism to be too extreme despite me trying to tell her that it’s really easy to go these days. Another thing she’s done is grate on me for being too cynical and negative since coming out as an atheist, something that coincided with many transition to vegetarianism, but I make it clear that I find these stances far more progressive and rational then hers despite my respect for the fact that she has hers (not the meat-consuming stance (it’s rooted in traditional appeal and natural appeal), but certainly the religious one). That said, in her defense, I will say I’ve certainly been too much of both, and I’ll admit I haven’t really done a good job at being a positive advocate for both positions. I’m rarely around to advise them, sometimes I seem to belittle too much, and the products I purchase (either with my parents’ money or my own, mostly the latter at this point) are quite expensive (stuff like certain meat substitutes, Daiya cheese (anyone know of a suitable substitute that’s both cheap and more healthy, or could I get cheese for free at a farmer’s market considering my current freeganism?), etc.), and I’m trying to change that while also accounting for my peanut allergy (and trying to avoid other tree nuts along the way).

What I do know from my mom’s side of the family is that one of her brothers (who’s also my favourite uncle) has actually made quite a few commitments to try out at least going vegetarian, even showing a screenshot of a vegan dinner to me. Considering both this and her willingness to give up red meat, it leaves me the slightest bit hopeful that she’ll go at least vegetarian (or maybe pescatarian as she still eats seafood quite a bit, and there is at least viable nutrition in that product (HDL cholesterol and omega 3)) before the age of 60 (I’ll be almost 30 by that point).

As for my dad and both of their stances on animals, I don’t know what to do. Both he and my mom showed interest in the horse taking in the image above and even a rodeo stadium, while I was repulsed. When I showed them what horses in the Kentucky Derby, I urged them to think of the consequences of paying to go to the derby (especially my dad, who’s a Derby representative), while my mom tried countering back telling me that the horses there are treated well despite the evidence I had at my disposal (though to give her the benefit of the doubt, she hasn’t showed me any evidence towards the horses being treated well, and I may be wrong and have acted too hastily). What do you think I should do from here? I don’t want to end up being too pushy and forcing them to quit cold turkey, not only because I want to be more considerate to my parents, but also because I don’t want to come off as a hypocrite.",592470,1619017769,2021-04-21 23:09:29,45357,0,1

One of the game's features is a dragon that inhabits your city, which grows and evolves various powers. Up til this morning, the dragon did this when enough little gold experience icons were collected.

This morning, those icons were changed to slabs of meat, to be fed to the dragon. They show up whenever rewards are collected, which is often. And they're at the top of my list of items, so I can't do much of anything without being confronted with graphics of raw meat and slabs of ribs.

I've bailed on new games in the past, over their insensitive handling of meat and dairy production. But having this dropped into a game I've enjoyed for so long is really disheartening.

DIARY = BEEF. 

People only act according to their level of knowledge which includes not only the reality of the process of the end product, but also the understanding of how brutal it is to be stuck in a meat machine. People want to find a middleground, a respect for each other's decisions. Honey, there IS no middleground, there's only the truth and they are blind to it. There is no middleground when their facts are paid by the meat industry and influenced by parents, friends and school through upbringing. There is no middleground when they actively decide to not recognize that the suffering of others DOES matter for the simple fact that they exist and suffers because of us.

I hope to show that being vegan can also mean being strong, as I won't let my numbers decline, and they will only increase. I've already moved on to a vegan protein powder the other day (KOS), and that was just the beginning. I also happen to take Ritual multivitamins which are actually vegan after looking it up. 

**This is a post to myself, even if nobody sees it, this is it** \- I'm fucking done. From this point forward I'm done consuming meat. This will be the hardest thing in the world for me, as for packing on all that muscle and weighing 300lbs, I've eaten a lot of meat during my life. 

I'm hoping a make a difference, I'm hoping I become healthier, and I'm hoping that in my life time lab grown meat becomes a common thing to stop these fucking animals from being killed like their less than ants.

I probably won't post again. But please, keep making posts promoting veganism, because believe it or not, it does work - as I, a meathead powerlifter will now only be consuming plants. 

Thank you all for being kind to animals.

Really struggling with the frustration I have. I need help rationalising my thoughts and putting my opinions to my family in a constructive manner.

My mum was diagnosed with Terminal Pancreatic cancer in January. It is inoperable and can only be ""cured"" with chemotherapy to control the spreading. She is only 52. She does not smoke, she does not drink, she is fit, she is healthy BMI, she did everything right, but she got diagnosed with up to 2 years left of her life. I am a vegan for health, animal and environmental reasons and have been for a few years- she eats meat daily and I do believe her cancer is somewhat rooted in it. My family have always mocked me for being vegan or not taken it seriously, and it has never bothered me until now because they don't believe me. I am trying to persuade them that my mother needs AT LEAST a vegetarian diet, as pancreatic cancer is linked to meat. They won't listen and we have had huge argument about it. Her sister (my aunt) is her carer and feels personally attacked when I mention it, as if I am accusing her of killing my mother with food. She won't listen. I mention studies. She doesn't listen. I am so frustrated to tears about helping my mother- but how much is actually linked to her consumption of meat? Should I feel so passionately about the veganism now?

vegan,mupk1a,cannibal_chanterelle,Don't Need to be Quite so Vegan for the Environment.,"So, while I work, I tend to have Youtube playing in the background on autoplay because I have deep anxiety issues and sometimes the noise helps. Please forgive the following if it's a repost of some sort.

Anyway, a Vox video comes on discussing the best diets you can have to lower your impact on the environment. They briefly say something like: ""Sure veganism is the best for reducing your carbon footprint, but it's basically the same as vegetarianism. Then they show graphs showing that vegetarianism is about two times as environmentally impactful, but whatever, it's relative to meat consumption. Vegetarianism is still exponentially better than being an everyday meat eater, sure, no quarrels.

However, the video goes out of its way to say that no one is asking people to give up meat, that would be craaaazy. So the real thing you do, is just cut your meat consumption to the doctor recommended 4 ounces per meal and BAM! WORLD IS SAVED. Meanwhile, they note the Mediterranean diet and how it's mostly plant based. That diet is still many, many times more impactful on the diet than veganism. 4 ounces of meat a day is many many more impactful than the Mediterranean diet.

Clearly there is something fucky afoot here with the Vox video. Someone with more time to dig than me will probably know. Veganism is made as a brief aside and it's put in this condescending, ""You'd have to be a radical loony tune to be a vegan"" kind of way, despite the video demonstrating that veganism is well beyond the best diet (not to mention the larger implications of not objectifying animals for raw ""goods,"" for example, destroying their autonomy and quality of life for bullshit material ""goods"") for the environment. Why would they not make veganism and vegetarianism corner stones of a video discussing the best diets for the environmentally conscious? Veganism is beyond better for the environment than any other diet, yet it's relegated to an obligatory call out and condescension.

Any thoughts on this? Am I insane for reading conspiracy in an otherwise fine video?",592028,1618922962,2021-04-20 20:49:22,140164,6,1

I was eating some carrots during a pause break and my dad facetiously mentioned something about ""the poor carrots that we pulled from the ground when all they wanted to do was grow"" and I calmly responded with ""Plants are different from animals. They don't have central nervous systems, and even if they did feel pain, ~75% of the plants we grow go to feed animals that we eat. So if plants do feel pain, it's still better to eat just plants""  and he just didn't respond. No jabs, nothing. (I don't remember the actual statistic so that may even be an underestimation)

I couldn't help but cry when my mom brought up zoos, and I told her I voted against them in the last election when our local zoo asked for more money, because ultimately it is wrong to keep any animal in captivity. My ""fun day off"" at the zoo is not worth their entire lives in captivity and it's wrong.

So once (definitely some time before Corona) an omnivore friend of mine visited me and at the time of her visit „Dominion“ was shown at our „college cinema“ (little cinema, with only one movie airing about two weeks, from students for students inside a bid lecture hall on the university campus) 
As a (vegan) friend of mine was in the college cinema club (the students that organize everything) I promised him me and my friend will go watch that movie.

I already was vegan at the time for a while but never watched „Dominion“ before so I had no idea how „hard and cruely honest“ that movie is.

She watched the whole film crying about how horrible the whole system is and how people can do that to the poor animals to a point where I felt legit bad for taking her to that movie and even considered leaving the lecture hall with her (which I didn‘t because I was just overwhelmed with the situation)

In the end she was super convinced to become a vegan too, went home had nightmares a couple of days and after only one week she was back being a happy omnivore and I - still to this day - just don‘t get it!

How can someone watch this movie which shows you the realistic truth about what is happening and then just decides to totally ignore it and continue with their former lifestyle?? o.O

And such people are they hopeless of ever turning vegan or why did this happen the way it did?

As already mentioned above I would love to hear your opinions on that regard.",591769,1618873763,2021-04-20 07:09:23,189363,40,1

I am a 18 year old athlete living off in college. I have been vegan for almost two years now but still face an embarrassing problem. I knew that when I originally started on my vegan journey that I would experience bloating and very smelly flatulence due to my decision to go “cold turkey”. But 2 years later, while I have loved the experience and have seen countless benefits, I still face horribly smelling flatulence. My roommate has been super understanding of my situation but I can’t seem to figure out why my gas smells so putrid. It is becoming unbearable for me and  quite frankly embarrassing. I try to hold it in for the sake of the people around me but this often leads to stomach pain/discomfort. I’m looking for advice on possible supplements/methods to improve my situation?

I recently reread the article, and I was really floored.

vegan,mu83bi,Sbeast,The Sentience of Animals,"**Introduction**

Sentience is the capacity to be aware of feelings and sensations, and is sometimes used interchangeably with 'self-awareness', or 'consciousness'. The sentience of many animal species has been overlooked and neglected for much of history and this trend continues to this day. This post hopes to address this by highlighting some lesser known facts about the behaviour and sentience of various different animals, especially those that are routinely exploited or killed for human consumption.

What traits or properties do humans have that grant them sentience and moral rights? Is it emotions? The ability to think? Behaviours? Being able to breathe? Consciousness? The ability to feel pain? The desire to live? What traits or properties do dogs have that grant them sentience and moral rights, and how are these fundamentally any different from a pig, cow, sheep, goat, chicken, or fish?

What vegans want more than anything, is not for people to give up meat, eat more carrots, or stop going to the circus; what we want is for nonvegans to realise, appreciate and respect the sentience of other animals to a satisfactory degree. If they are able to do that, then it is very likely that they will do the aforementioned things.

For many thousands of years, humans have been unfairly grouping animals into categories of arbitrary moral worth, i.e the ‘scapegoat’ and the ‘sacred’. For example, cats were worshipped in ancient Egypt, cows are seen as sacred in India, and typically dogs are favoured in Western countries. Conversely, Japan has hunted whales for many centuries, bulls are tortured in Spain, and both dogs and cats are eaten in China. It is time to end this arbitrary discrimination, and try to treat animals more fairly and equally. Similar to racism, and sexism, legalised speciesism will one day become a thing of the past and future generations will look back in dismay.

**Fish 🐟**

&gt;“Having examined the research that has been done for some species of fish (a relatively small number of species have been studied), this panel concludes: “The balance of the evidence indicates that some fish species have the capacity to experience pain.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“In the light of evidence reviewed … it is recommended that, where considerations of welfare are involved, all vertebrate animals (i.e., mammals birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish) should be regarded as equally capable of suffering to some degree or another, without distinction between ‘warm-blooded’ and ‘cold blooded’ members.” \[**Source**: [http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-welfare-in-commercial-fishing/fish-sentience](http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-welfare-in-commercial-fishing/fish-sentience)\]

* “In her very interesting book called Do Fish Feel Pain? Dr. Braithwaite concluded, ‘I have argued that there is as much evidence that fish feel pain and suffer as there is for birds and mammals — and more than there is for human neonates and preterm babies.’” \[**Source**: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201406/fish-are-sentient-and-emotional-beings-and-clearly-feel-pain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201406/fish-are-sentient-and-emotional-beings-and-clearly-feel-pain)\]
* “Fish fulfil several criteria proposed as indicating that non-human animals may experience pain. These fulfilled criteria include a suitable nervous system and sensory receptors, opioid receptors and reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and local anaesthetics, physiological changes to noxious stimuli, displaying protective motor reactions, exhibiting avoidance learning and making trade-offs between noxious stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements.” \[**Source**: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain\_in\_fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_fish)\]

**Rats 🐀**

&gt;“However, a recent study has found ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42690577](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42690577)) that it was humans rather than rats that were responsible for the spread of the Black Death.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Today, in parts of Africa rats are helping to save lives and fight disease. The charity Apopo, working with the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania, trains rats to react to the scent of explosives, enabling them to detect landmines in countries including Tanzania, Mozambique and Cambodia. The detection of landmines is usually an expensive business, and countries often lack the resources to carry out the time-consuming and complicated work. A human using a metal detector would take 25 hours to search a 200-sq-m area - a rat can do the same work in 20 minutes. Apopo's James Pursey explains that not only are rats cheaper than dogs, they are also light enough that they don't set off the landmines.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“And it's not just landmines. Rats can also smell out the odour specific to tuberculosis. Every year, three million people infected by TB go undiagnosed and therefore do not receive the care they need. Apopo say that their trained rats can screen 100 samples in 20 minutes - a task that would take a lab technician four days. The samples detected by rats are then rechecked using World Health Organisation (WHO) endorsed confirmation tests.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Not only can they help clear mines rats, their owners will tell you, also make good pets. Pets4Homes points out that contrary to their reputation rats are clean animals and spend more time grooming themselves than cats. Rachel Heaton is the publicity officer for Yorkshire Rats Club and an owner of 15 rats. She told the BBC that: ""Rats are so affectionate and so in tune with their owners' emotions."" ""When I had my appendix out one of my rats could sense I was unwell and instead of trying to play as he usually does he sat quietly licking my hand."" ""You can also teach them to do tricks - there is one woman who taught her rat to fetch her a tissue every time she sneezed.”” \[**Source**: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42708127](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42708127)\]

**Conclusion**

Animals are alive, sentient, experience emotions, can feel pain, and desire to live and be free just like humans. The sentience of animals needs to become more widely known, and by further educating ourselves and others, we can help transition to a vegan world where animals are treated much better.

**Nike Rep**: Thank you for waiting. Nothing to worry, the Nike Air Force 1 '07 is a syntethic leather.

vegan,mu6r2b,times28,if the world was completely vegan ...,"imagine a world where nobody eats animal products. everyone is vegan. there are laws preventing the slaughter of animals for consumption. we're at a time where veganism is so normalised that eating meat and animal products is simply unfathomable (just like the idea that women couldn't wear pants is weird). what a nice world right. 

but my question is, how would we call the meat/egg and other substitutes. would we still call these products vegan chicken, vegan meat, egg replacer, etc? or would we just come up with new names for these kind of foods? idk if my question sounds dumb or not but what are you guys' thoughts on that?",591669,1618856010,2021-04-20 02:13:30,207116,7,1
vegan,mu6pdj,Rogvir,I helped a friend of mine by playing ambulance and driving him to the hospital and he wanted to thank me by going Vegan for a month. How do I support him and maybe convince him to stay Vegan?,"As the Title suggests I got a call three days ago from one of my friends who was in great pain both physically and mentally.

He has no other person who could help so i hopped in my car drove to his place and brought him to the hospital.

During the ride he was joking about my veganism again but also offered to go Vegan for a Month as a thank you.

I didn't suggest this or implied it in any way, this was all his idea.

Now a little detail about him.

He is a 33 year old who consumes a lot of meat and other animal products on a daily basis and also a massive manchild with the same edgy/racist humor of his 13 year old self.

His ""ultimate"" argument against Veganism is that he thinks that it is gay.

He is already strugling because of his old habits and because he is very much impulse driven.

So how do I support him staying on the right path and may also let him stay Vegan?",591668,1618855878,2021-04-20 02:11:18,207248,10,1

I come to you active animal lovers with a work that you guys inspired me to create. It is a comic book story based on a steer destined for slaughter. I tried my absolute best to tell the animal's perspective. I did a ton of research to put myself in the animal's shoes to create this story, and I'm incredibly proud of it. It's still in development, and as soon as it's done, I am sending everybody a five-page preview of the comic book for free to show you how I told their story. I spent a lot of time and money creating this story for you guys. I will be raising capital and selling the book on Kickstarter, and I'm also willing to give 5% of my funds donated to your cause.  It will mean the world to me if you share and click the link to be instantly notified of the launch. These animals need to be understood and heard, and we can do it together one story at a time.

vegan,mu43h3,deltafoxtrot8,Asking for some opinions on possibly controversial issues,"Okay so even though I'm a fairly new vegan, I'm aware there is no such thing as 'sustainable farming', and I have no intentions of doing any of these things, I just wanted some opinions &amp; discussion.

What would be your opinion on a family that had land and kept their own chickens that laid a natural amount of eggs which they then ate? &amp; the same for cow's milk ?

What is your opinion on deerstalking, not for sport but to keep their numbers under control? Their natural predators, wolves, were sadly made extinct by humans and now deer numbers can get so out of control that they don't have enough food. Would you judge someone for eating flesh of a stag that had been shot in order to control their numbers? 

Again, I'm not condoning this I just wanted to see what people think and hopefully learn something in the process :)

One of my best online friends that I am generally very close with told me she went vegan a week ago! She was one of the ""I love animals, but humans are just made to eat meat"" people (I used to be, too) and I managed to change her opinion mostly through a text-role play featuring a very soft character with an animal-sanctuary. 

She even says imagining him being disappointed in her eating animal products is her main motivation rn, because she doesn't feel mentally stable enough to watch heart-wrenching documentaries like Earthlings etc. right now, she believes me when I say it's horrible.

Might be a bit of a weird path, but it worked and I'm very proud of her! :D It feels great to make a change, even if it's just a small victory. Now I'm trying my best to make the start as easy as possible for her, with providing recipes and tips.",591574,1618837747,2021-04-19 21:09:07,225379,9,1

vegan,mtxv4x,allison5,Family members comments about animals are so aggravating,"A few gems from my family members (which is so tough because I love them SO MUCH and they’re great people):

The first was on thanksgiving, sitting around the table looking out the window. We live on a corner in an area with wild turkeys, and people fly around our corner because there is no stop sign. There was a group of ~5 turkeys in the middle of the road at the corner, and my mom with so much concern was genuinely afraid someone would come around the corner and hit them/hurt them/kill them. While she’s eating turkey.... like you’re SO close!!! 

Another regularly says people who abuse animals (aka dogs..) should be shot 0.0 

And then this weekend, the comment that inspired the post. We were commenting on how it’s funny that people in our neighborhood see the same people walking, and always notice if they don’t have their dog with them when they usually do, or if they don’t see the owner and dog out for a while, people get concerned that something happened to the dog. My sibling just goes “it’s so funny how people are so connected to animals and so concerned for animals that their first thought is to ask about the dog rather than the person when they haven’t seen them for a bit”. YES. EXACTLY. People inherently care about animals? Why is it so much of a stretch to expand that care beyond dogs and cats? So close.. yet so so far. They ordered a chicken sandwich shortly after the comment. 

I love my family. And they do care - no one wants to see animals hurt or suffering. But my goodness, it’s just... it’s like they need one more push. But I say NOTHING because I’m the “preachy vegan” of course.

vegan,mtvo08,FearlesslyTheldiot,Tadpoles in pool?,"Hey guys, not sure where else to post this but I need some advice. My family has neglected our pool throughout the fall and winter, it looks and acts like an actual pond right now. There's frogs that sit out to sunbathe on the floating vacuum tube each morning and snakes that slither away when they sense you nearby. Anyways two days ago we saw that a fresh batch of tadpoles have been born and they are staying near the steps where the water is shallow. I have seen a grown frog (mom??) stay near them but will swim away if you get too close. 

My parents are talking about moving them and I just don't know what to do. I know they will haphazardly move them to a puddle or something. Where is the best place to put them and how do I move them? There has to be &gt;100 tadpoles in the pool. Are there ""professionals"" out there who can safely move them? It also makes me worried because there's a mom frog who just gets lost in the dark pool. If it was up to me I would let them grow up in the pool but it takes like 12 weeks... all summer, and my family has an issue with that. What do you guys think?

vegan,mtvb5v,Gidon_147,Honey,"I would like to know what your opinion on Honey is. It is one of those things where I am not entirely sure about.  
First of all: I don't eat honey anymore, because i just categorically rule out eating any animal product. I also just got used to the 200 alternatives that have different tastes which i simply find better.

  
I live in Germany, where Bees and a lot of other insect species are endangered. I have heard some points about that beekeeping actually saves the bees form going extinct in Germany, because, well, Germany is a country mostly centered around profit and industry. I am not sure if it is ethical to collectively stop buying and eating honey (local, from Germany, otherwise there is no point and you should NEVER import honey from somewhere else anyway), because I am not sure if bees will survive as a species in the wild when they are not kept for their honey.  


A counter argument would be that Bees can also be kept/supported without exploiting and stressing them out for their honey, because they take a large part in pollinating plants that can be used for vegan honey substitutes. I am however not sure if this is sustainable or possible in Germany to do.  


I would like to know your opinions. Is it okay for people to eat honey and support beekeeping, for saving the bees? Or should the bees be left alone and their honey never be harvested, and other measures be taken to ensure their species' survival?",591503,1618816702,2021-04-19 15:18:22,246424,11,1

vegan,mtt3wv,Fosui,How hard was it for you to swap from a omni to vegan?,"In my case, it took a week to swap from my daily salami and sharp cheddar sandwich daily lunch to vegan products. It was a few months of me trying other products like meatballs and burgers that snuck milk powder in to get it down that I need to read labels, but I want to hear other people's experiences.

I will note that I think I'm crazy privileged to have alternatives around me that made the easy switch because I never really cared about good food. I was the type of person to buy the same lunch, snacks, and dinner week on week without needing variety so it was an easy switch.

The biggest reason I ask is because my sister mentioned that she wants to go vegetarian and some friends recently watched seaspiricy and want to cut out fish, but for me it seemed so easy to cut out all of those things and it makes it hard to see the point of view where you can cut out something like meat or fish but not cheese and milk which are huge components of the animal agriculture society.",591477,1618806798,2021-04-19 12:33:18,256328,16,1
vegan,mtt2pk,13yoPan,I just became vegan today!,"My brother just sat with me for like 20 minutes telling me how insanely unhealthy meat and dairy actually is so how could I not. Also it'll make my low calorie diet easier because fruits and vegetables have more carbs and carbs are more filling. It's crazy how people are fine with having a corpse inside their body just because of how it tastes. Meat isn't even that good. It's the stuff that you put on me that makes it taste good. No one would eat a burger without seasoning or anything on it because it wouldn't taste like anything. It's not even meat that taste good! There are plenty of crappy things that you can make taste good by putting a shit ton of salt on it. Also my sister got diabetes because of dairy. (There's something in dairy that attacks your pancreas.) Eating meat is literally putting a corpse inside of your body so that it can rot in your stomach. That's disgusting. Why would anybody want rotting flesh inside of them for any amount of time. The truth is meat just isn't that good! Eggs aren't even that good! I mean an egg isn't even a baby chicken! It's a chicken period! Why would anyone want to eat a chicken period. Anyway, sorry for the tangent lmao.

I have kind of always been super hungry (I run alot and am pretty active and just generally have a large appetite) but lately it is becoming something more than that. 

I can eat an entire pot of pasta and still be so hungry, I feel like no matter how much I eat I am never full. I have already started to notice some weight gain and I try to limit my food to be more normal and just wait out the hunger but it just never seems to end.
Trying high fat/ protein and high carb diets haven’t affected my appetite in the slightest. 

When I talk about this with people it seems clear to them that this is because of my veganism (vegan for 5+ years). I am vegan for the animals and not health but I am getting scared that this may be affecting my health...

I purchased a Bella - Rocket Extract Pro Table Top Blender - 700 W - Black, Stainless Steel Model: BLA13984 in 2015 for $35. The things been a champ up until a few days ago when I went to grind up some almonds (if I started chewing on whole almonds I'd break every tooth in my mouth) and for the first time I smelled the motor laboring. Could be bearings could be normal wear and tear but I need to replace it with something that **can** and is **promoted** and **designed** for grinding nuts. I thought I found a replacement, the NutriBullet - Rx Blender - Black
Model: N17-1001 on sale for $70 dollars but I was subsequently told by customer service that this blender? is not designed to grind nuts.

Took me a while but i found natural alternatives, which were tryptophan and tyrosine 500mg it was recommended in a book called the mood cure, you can search for it as i have posted about it in other subs.  


Anywho, most of the brands had gelatin, so i looked for those with vegetarian capsules and found a brand, i have been using that same brand for a while until recently i just learned they source from animals for the actual vitamin. I am a 4 yr vegan and i still make mistakes due to all this misleading stuff, i mean why use vegetarian capsules if the product already contains animal ingredients. Of course, none of the vitamin brands actually list on the bottle ALL of the ingredients or where they come from, you either have to ask on amazon or ask the company directly. The safest way is to find vitamins that specifically say VEGAN which i now have learned.  


I mean i guess i cant say im surprised when plant based just means it contains plants but could have dead carcass in there as well. Figured i would provide this alert to others though as many of us might not realize this.  


I dont feel bad cause i didnt know, i thought they were vegan and feeling bad does nothing to help. Some vegans exclude medical stuff from veganism so to them it doesnt matter if drugs/ vitamins contain animal ingredients or not, i personally do care and i also find it gross to consume animal carcasses and their secretions.",591316,1618774946,2021-04-19 03:42:26,288180,4,1
vegan,mtj3bu,BlueDogBlueFrog,"Dog owners, do you feed your dogs meat or plant based kibbles?","I don't have a dog, but have been thinking of adopting one day. I grew up with dogs and love them, but since I became vegan 2 months ago, this is by far the most troubling thing to me. 

From what I understand there isn't really a peer-reviewed study/consensus on wether dogs can thrive on a vegan diet. 

Would most vets say this is okay or would they advise against it? The things is i think it might be really hard to get a non-biased opinion.

Its such a fucked up sitaution that it makes me really not ever want to adopt. I just can't see how I could justify buying kibble made from factory farming. Why does a dog deserve to live more than a pig, cow or chicken? There is no way I can justify that. Especially kibble made from factory farming remains. 

On the other hand, when I had dogs I had a really close bond with them. I would risk my life for my dogs without question. If I ended up slowly killing my dog or giving it irreversible damage by feeding it an improper diet, I would never forgive myself. Never. 

Its a crappy situation. I have read people on this sub have dogs with allergies/specific food requirements. My fear would be that for example my dog had allergies and 5 different vets reccomended that he/she must eat a certain food that lets say contained meat. Wtf do you do in that scenario? How can I pay for the torture and slaughter of countless animals that all have their personalities, emotions, experiences to sustain my dog? Or how can I willingly slowly kill my dog? 

I just don't know what the fuck I would to in this situation. Its extremely scary to think about it. I know a lot of dogs can do great on a vegan diet, but even the mere chance that the dog I adopt might not be able to, is terrifying.

I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

I am also not here to hate on veganism.  
I am simply here to have a civil discussion on how to reduce the amount of stigma there is around veganism.  
I am also considering, after I go to university that I could go vegan if the meat and dairy substitutes drop in price, because right now I don't see me being able to afford $4 for a meat substitute.

There are many vegans who will suggest going vegan, that in itself, is not a problem. But when you get into insulting people and guilt-tripping them for not being vegan, I believe THAT is what causes so much stigma. I realize not every vegan is like this, but for those who realize they have done something like this, or are still doing stuff like this, I would like to remind that at the end of the day, it is the other person's choice.

vegan,mtgtzl,RockyRob97,One of the more complicated carnists I've encountered. What to do?," So I've been working with this guy around my age, let's call him Tom. It came up in discussions between us that I am vegan and he was asking me about it, saying usual stuff like ""I could never do that"" and telling me how moral of a person I was. He is very affectionate towards animals, he goes through great lengths to not even harm insects and gets upset whenever he sees videos of animals being abused. Seems a perfect person to work on right? 

I told him he should try look into watching Dominion or Earthlings to try to get the motivation to commit to being vegan and I would help anyway I could. He then told me that he has seen Earthlings. And he has read Animal Liberation. And he has seen Gary Yourofsky's speech. And he has been through PETA's website. He told me in no uncertain terms that \*he completely agrees with animal rights philosophy\*, understands why speciesism is wrong (first carnist who's brought that up before me), is totally against even medical testing on animals (!), but ultimately, he says he just knows he does not have the willpower to consume a vegan diet. 

He doesn't wear any animal materials, doesn't buy from companies that test on animals, doesn't donate to charities that test on animals, doesn't go to zoos, circuses, bet on horse racing etc. He essentially doesn't exploit animals at all, \*except for dietary purposes\*.

I asked him how he could be so opposed to these things yet have no issue with animals being abused for their meat, milk and eggs. He just said that he couldn’t commit to it because 1) it would be extremely difficult for him (his diet is apparently \~ 80% animal products) and 2) he doesn’t believe the vegan philosophy will win out in the end even if it is the more rational ethical approach (he uses the fact that animal consumption is constantly on the rise and the fact that most vegans go back to eating animals). These two things he said would make him very bitter on a vegan diet – essentially “sacrificing his mental health for a goal that won’t be reached”

He did tell me he was sympathetic to the lives of farm animals, and the best he could do is two things that he currently does:

1) He plans to have no children

2) He donates $30 monthly to Compassion in World Farming

Should I just give up on him? He seems the perfect person to be a vegan and is very knowledgeable on AR philosophy (he’s a card-carrying member of PETA!) and would be an asset for the movement. I definitely think the two things he does above are better than most people’s apathy but I don’t know if I should try to get him to even consider vegetarianism?

vegan,mtb0qq,vampygalxx,Thank you!!,"Hi everyone!

I posted here a few days ago about the fact that my partner has gone vegan and I was considering joining him. I have been a vegetarian since I was 11 (nearly 29 now) and have never really considered being a vegan as I always felt like I was doing my part and actually have felt proud of myself for living my entire adult life without consuming meat, gelatine, Carmine etc. Since watching game changers and not being able to bring myself to watch Dominion, every time I have had something with dairy and since then I have felt guilty and almost anxious around the fact that I’m going to be eating it. 

Your comments and support on my last post, and through reading things people post and discuss on this forum has made educating myself and making my decision so much easier. I still have some things in the house that contain dairy such as cereal bars and porridge and I am not in a financial position to throw them away, but I have put in an order from a vegan online supermarket and I’m now re-searching the best place local to get my groceries. 

Thank you so much for helping me make this decision. I’m all for the animals. I genuinely thought I was doing better than most by being vegetarian. It’s sad that I have been part of the problem. Here’s to a new me ♥️♥️",591117,1618745037,2021-04-18 19:23:57,318089,15,1
vegan,mtaw7t,chellemedus,How do you make YOUR scrambled tofu?,"I take either silken or firm tofu, break it up into a pot, add a few drops of water, turn up the heat, add turmeric, cumin, salt, pepper, basil, garlic, and nutritional yeast. Mix it all in and wait til it's hot, then put on top of some buttered toast. 

When I first went vegan this is one of the first recipes I found and I thought that this was just the only way people made it. I've see other recipes over the years but made the realisation today that a lot of people seem to not make this recipe at all? Most the recipes I'm finding don't use cumin and a bunch of them not even nutritional yeast? Which explains why I often don't like scrambled tofu at restaurant as for me cumin &amp; nooch are the most important ingredients haha.

So, I'm curious, how do you make it? :)",591113,1618744468,2021-04-18 19:14:28,318658,19,1

vegan,mt9on7,JackTheHCIM,If a factory creates a vegan product and handles milk products is it ethical?,"So for a while I’ve been eating these rice pots (Naked szechuan rice). The ingredients list doesn’t contain any animal products and the pot is recyclable apart from the lid. I recently noticed that the label says “suitable for vegetarians” and started wondering why it wasn’t vegan. The only thing I have come up with is that it says the factory where it is made also handles milk.

I haven’t had one since I read this but I have a busy work schedule of around 12 hours a day with not much free time to eat so these are ideal as they only require hot water.

vegan,mt7oxw,NewZealandBrewer,Can I sue a restaurant for putting meat in a dish marked vegetarian?,"I live in New Zealand and just left a Thai restaurant that I have frequented for years. They know us by name and we have spent thousands of dollars there over the years. We only order dishes marked with a V for vegetarian. And additionally we always stress that we are strict vegetarians and that they leave out any fish, oyster sauce, or egg, just in case. Tonight we found out that they have all along been using chicken stock in their dishes. We were really upset but tried to respectfully explain to them that a vegetarian would never expect that anything marked as “vegetarian” would have chicken stock. But they wouldn’t even apologize. They started by saying “it’s not chicken, it’s chicken stock” and that “most vegetarians don’t mind a little chicken stock”, and when I tried to make it clear that this is not the case, they tried to somehow justify it by telling us that we’ve been “eating chicken stock in their food for years”, as if this made it ok. Long story short, they wouldn’t take any responsibility for it. No apology, no refund, and they basically said if we are vegan they can’t serve us because all of their food has chicken stock in it. 

Like many, my veganism is just about a religious thing. I could have chalked it up to ignorance had they apologized. But the fact that they took no responsibility, nor gave any interest in changing their labels, makes me furious and I’d like to take action if that’s possible.

Do I have any legal rights here or grounds to sue for emotional damage? My daughter is in tears (as she has never knowingly eaten meat in her entire life) and this is the second time in a week a restaurant has given her a dish with meat in it. This really upsets me and I wonder how many other vegetarians have eaten chicken at this restaurant, assuming the food was vegetarian? Thousands, I’m sure.

Any advice?",591025,1618727793,2021-04-18 14:36:33,335333,28,1

vegan,mswofn,i_dreamed_of,Going vegan while breastfeeding - what to ask dietician?,"Breastfeeding and having a child have made me realise that I need to go vegan. 

At the same time, I am fairly uneducated when it comes to nutrition. I’ve always been basically an accidental intuitive eater, which worked when it was just me, but I’m worried about maintaining my milk supply and ensuring that my baby gets everything he needs.

To this end, I want to go to a dietician for some advice. But I live in the Midwest and am nervous that I will not find one who is supportive. For example my therapist is actively against this decision (I don’t totally understand why; I think she’s worried it’s too big a lifestyle change to take on while I’m also dealing with a newborn). 

I’ve reached out to two dieticians I found online who had veganism listed as a speciality and not heard back. Wanted to ask this forum for some advice:

1. Any other EBF parents who have some advice that worked for them? (Not medical advice for me obvi)

2. What are watch outs when I do meet with a dietician? For example from reading this sub I know that not getting enough protein is a myth and if they bring that up they probably aren’t the right fit. Other topics I should make sure they do or don’t bring up? Common myths, etc to be aware of here? 

3. General advice on the switch appreciated!! 

For context on what I’m doing currently (started around a week ago): all meals are vegan (cooking everything at home), taking b12, but haven’t cut out dairy everywhere because I haven’t started reading labels closely for hidden things (for example ate some tortilla chips yesterday that it turns out had dairy in them.

Once I stumbled upon earthling Ed’s videos after watching Okja, I instantly converted. I didn’t try to justify it. I looked at the truth and became honest with myself.

I'm somewhat new and still learning, but recently the gravity of everything has really been hitting home for me and fucking with me in ways that I wasn't particularly expecting. I've known that I probably shouldn't consume animal products for a while, and sort of just accepted that without needing to really expose myself to the reality of everything, so I never really sat down to watch like slaughterhouse footage or anything because I didn't feel like I needed that and that I already understood bad things happen. 

But just being more aware of everything has turned me in a way that I wasn't expecting. First there were these sorts of notions of needing to reduce, followed by flirtations with veganism with some apologetic arguments, to committing oneself to it, to just the 'shit gets real' gravity of the situation that hits and your perceptions of things start changing and you know you're not going back.

I had a feeling wearing something identifying myself as a vegan could offend some people, which is why my first shirt just said “Vegan” instead of something more activist.

Has it really gotten this bad for us? Now I’m worried I might be targeted elsewhere.",590598,1618637866,2021-04-17 13:37:46,425260,16,1

vegan,mshej9,jillianjiggs92,I need your help! (In preparing for the weirdest debate),"Hello fellow Vegans,

So a non-vegan friend of mine wants to have a ""reverse"" debate. In this, I'll be arguing against Veganism and she'll be arguing for. My initial reaction was ""wow that's dumb... why would I argue against veganism - I've already thought it through and none of the arguments have held up.""

But here's the kicker - she hasn't. So while I need to (somehow) try to find some points for not being Vegan that aren't complete garbage, SHE will be researching on all the reasons to be vegan. So instead of me rambling to her/asking her questions, she'll be engaging with the material and actually thinking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I need your help!

Easy part: Send me all your favourite articles/book chapters for me to send her way. Keep in mind that she is a little resistant, and doesn't totally see why I'm so against harming/eating animals. She still views cows, pigs, and chickens as ""food"". So materials that challenge that view may be the most effective.   


Hard part: Send me all the arguments people have said at you for why you shouldn't be vegan. I'm really struggling with this. I just can't fathom not being vegan, so arguing this side is going to be a huge challenge. But the better I argue, the better she has to (and the better she'll engage with the material.). 

I want to take this as seriously as I can, and hopefully if I avoid just straw-manning and she can still argue against my points, she'll see how irrational it is to not be Vegan.",590529,1618623485,2021-04-17 09:38:05,439641,11,1

I think the narration covers far more about the irrationality of speciesism and is better structured the way it's split into Pets, Food, Clothes, Entertainment, Science as opposed to just going animal by animal like Dominion. 

Dominion just feels like 2 hours of slaughterhouse footage, there's no talk of speciesism. The only advantage I'd say it has is that the footage is better, but this cancels with the fact it's explicitly filmed in  Australia so can leave viewers in other countries ""it's not like that here""

Am I the only one who feels this way? I'm not sure if I would've been convinced by Dominion as a newcomer. I think I would've just said ""yeah the abuse is wrong, but using animals when we don't abuse them is OK""",590512,1618618795,2021-04-17 08:19:55,444331,18,1

I didn't experience any problems for probably the first 2-3 years I suppose, but about a year ago I have been experiencing tiredness and some dizziness.

I started taking a multivitamin and literally felt fine again a couple days later. I've been taking a multivitamin since then, I tried to stop taking it a few months ago but experienced a lot of dizziness. However the past year I have been eating really unhealthy, basically no fruit or veg and a lot of junk food + plus was sat down inside all day due to covid so I assume that played a role? 

I've been eating healthier now the past few months and want to try to stop taking my multivitamin again as I really don't want to have to take one. But when I look up how to get every nutrient/vitamin naturally it seems a bit pricey for certain things.

For example, to get omega 3 I need to buy like flax seeds or chia seeds or seaweed which is really not within my budget? Most vitamins seem easy to get, there's just a few that seem a bit more pricey, such as iodine as well? It's all a bit confusing and I'm scared that I'm gonna have bad long-term effects on my health if I'm not getting enough of something, but also can't spend a lot of money.

I really love tofu, and it always comes in a plastic container! I get the logistics of it, but now I have to learn to make my own tofu so i can minimize the sheer amount of plastic I consume. The mock meats I love SO much? Plastic! Even if it's in a cardboard box, you open it up and inside the cardboard box? Plastic! So now I have to learn how to make my own veggie burgers and seitan (although they are supposedly not hard). But for beyond meat? Impossible meat? GARDEIN? It's just not fair that the oil industry has bamboozled us so hard. I know plastic has it's uses, I just wish it wasn't EVERYWHERE the way that it is.

vegan,ms8fpo,I_AM_Selmo,"If people really cared about their kids or their grandkids, they would stop eating animal products and supporting those industries that profit off of the suffering and enslavement of animals","There, I said it. I apologize, but I'm going to rant for a minute. I had someone tell me recently ""If you were a ***real*** environmentalist, you wouldn't invest in crypto"". I mean, yes, crypto definitely has an environmental impact. But so does posting on Reddit, using Facebook, streaming videos and/or music on Netflix/Spotify. If our society ran on renewables, this wouldn't even be an argument. I hope that one day our society will diverge fully from fossil fuels onto renewables, and I am trying to make that happen as best I can but I'm only one person with limited capital and influence doing what I believe is possible to make a difference. But getting back to the main reason for this post.

That statement. It felt like it negated all of the changes that my wife and I have made in the last four years trying to be more environmentally-conscious and pro-animal safety and health. We use as little plastic as we can. We recycle as much as we can. We share a vehicle and only use it when absolutely necessary. We rarely travel. We compost. We eat a vegan diet, and avoid animal products as much as we can when it comes to other products.

I refuse to quit because of things like that. I believe in the beauty of this planet and the right to life of all the beings on it. I will do what I can to help protect it. I don't even have kids (nor do I want them) but I do want them to be able to look forward to the future like I did when I was younger. I feel sorry for the generations after me. I feel like they are definitely getting the short stick in terms of crumbs to live off of after my generation and those before me are gone.

Everyone seems to have this ""all or nothing"" mentality when it comes to making real change when in fact, this is often not feasible at all. When it comes to being a vegan, we went all in on that right off the hop, but I find most people like to break into it slowly. Maybe cut out meat gradually, then dairy, then eggs. Small changes lead to big things when done on a large scale. I saw a statement somewhere once that really resonated with me. It was something to the effect of ""We don't need a few people making major changes to get things on track, we need the majority of people making a few changes"".

End rant. Thank you for reading. Keep up the great work all you lovely people and stay safe! Together we will make a real difference.",590399,1618595037,2021-04-17 01:43:57,468089,0,1

vegan,ms80pc,hsrid,The essay that convinced me to become a vegan,"The very fact that one is alive means consuming nutrients ... and staying alive means that something, somewhere, must die in order to supply these nutrients. This is a fact of life ... and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it. One can argue about a belief, an opinion, a theory, an ideal and so on ... but a fact: never. One can deny a fact – pretend that it is not there – but once seen, a fact brings freedom from choice and decision. Most people think and feel that choice implies freedom – having the freedom to choose – but this is not the case. Freedom lies in seeing the obvious, and in seeing the obvious there is no choice, no deliberation, no agonising over the ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ judgment. In the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action.

When it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to. There are people who will not eat red meat at all ... only white meat and fish. Then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm-blooded animals at all ... only fish and reptiles. Then there are people (**vegetarians**) who will not eat any meat at all, but will consume eggs and dairy products. Then there are people (**vegans**) who will eat only vegetables, grain and seed. Then there are people (**fruitarians**) who will only eat fruit. Then – as we go into myth and fantasy – there are those who live on water and air ... and finally those who live on air only!

Some vegetarians maintain that as a carrot (for example) does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables. Yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life-support system – the ground is its home – and is this not distressing on some level of a living, growing organism? It all depends upon the level, or degree, of ‘aliveness’ that one ascribes to things. Vegans, for instance, will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born. Fruitarians go one step further and say that, as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life, vegetables are to be eschewed entirely. Then, as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life-forms from growing, they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant-form (I have been a fruitarian so I know full well what I am speaking of).

The obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration. What will one do – as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything – about those pesky things like mosquitoes, sand-flies, cockroaches, rats, mice and other ‘vermin’ that invade my house? Put up screens? What about outside? Will I slap them dead ... or just shoo them away? What will one do if attacked by a snake, a crocodile, a shark, a lion and so on? Do as the Revered Scriptures say and turn the other cheek? Will I humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself – or even killed – simply because of a religious injunction, a moral scruple, a noble ideal, a virtuous belief, a passionate opinion, a deeply held ethical theory? In other words, have animals and insects been given the right, by some inscrutable god, to do with me whatsoever they wish? Is my survival dependent upon the non-existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that I am not going to cause distress to?

What then about germs, bacteria, bacillus, microbes, pathogens, phages, viruses and so on? Are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free? If one takes medication for disease, one is – possibly painfully – killing off the microscopic creatures that one’s body is the host too. Some religions – the Jain religion in India, for example – has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature. It can really get out of hand. For instance, small-pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives ... is this somehow ‘Wrong’? What is ‘Right’ in regards to what I do in order to stay alive? If I do none of these things then I will be causing pain and suffering to myself ... and I am a sentient being too. It is an impossible scenario, when pursued to its ultimate conclusion.

And then there is the matter of one’s fellow human beings. Some of them – in fact at times a lot of them – are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in, with the avowed intent of killing, torturing, raping, pillaging and subjugating oneself and one’s fellow citizens. If one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian ... one must be a pacifist as well. This amounts to hanging out a sign – if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief – which says, in effect: ‘Please feel free to invade us, we will not fight back, for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever’ (the Tibetan situation is a particular case in point). Thus anarchy would rule the world ... all because of a belief system handed down by the Saints and the Sages, the Messiahs and the Avatars, the Redeemers and the Saviours, the Prophets and the Priests, century after century.",590394,1618593836,2021-04-17 01:23:56,469290,1,1

vegan,ms6kk5,Fareysia,My doctor told me to go vegan and I need advice,"My doctor told me to leave out milk products from my meals. So basically to go vegan. 🌱

I'm female, 21, and a Vegetarian for a couple of years already, and actually a huge cheese fan. Yikes.

How I ended up in my situation:
After I turned Vegetarian, I regularly got a rash or something at the finger knuckles of my right hand  - It swells, turns red, tickles and when you touch it, it hurts. This would occur every few months from then, staying for two weeks and then disappear. I hoped it would go away at some point. (I can't tell if turning Vegetarian was the reason it appeared,  I just know it's been happening for couple of years now)

Then a few months ago I started to get a stomach ache consistently, nearly every day. It's not strong or anything, but just always there.
It also didn't get better when I switched to oat milk (which is so much better than normal milk, whowie!). 🥳

Now I've went to let someone check my hand, and she was asking me if it occurs when I'm on my period, which isn't the case. (It could be because of hormones).
 So next she asked me how my stomach is feeling and I admitted that it troubles me a lot (Funnily I had to think for a moment cause the tummy ache was so normal for me 😅). 
She said, my intestine, so my stomach isn't alright, it afflicts my skin. She recommended me to leave out any milk products for at least four weeks and watch it. 👍🏻

Soooo I'm excited to go vegan!
Problem: I'm still living with my parents who aren't tooooo happy about me being Vegetarian already.... but they get vegetarian options for me at least. 🙈
But I can't stay dependant on them forever! Especially if I happen to become Vegan. I cant expect them to cook for me anymore. I need to... grow up 😱

But.... I'm just a terrible cook, and to be completely I've never been interested in cooking. It seems like such a bothersome task.. coming up with an idea, getting ingredients, stand there for 2 hours... 🙄 I'm lazy, I recognised it myself, thank you.
 
So I'm asking you guys for ANY useful advise that you can give me. Whether it is about motivating myself to cook, or vegan recipes, or venting about me being lazy, anything!
Also, do you agree with her theory that the skin rash is directly connected to my stomach condition? 
I appreciate any message I get 🙏



P.S.: Idk if this counts as over-asked question. If so, I am sorry and you may delete this post.",590363,1618589727,2021-04-17 00:15:27,473399,17,1

I’m so proud of him for taking the big step to go vegetarian/almost 100% vegan. He is almost completely vegan now except for the occasional cheese pizza or mac n cheese from work. He’s not perfect but he’s been doing an amazing job since January and I’m so proud of him! This is a guy who used to think bacon was life and every meal needs to have a meat protein. Initially we watched What The Health and it really changed his perception of animal products. He says he also does it for the animals now which is the main reason I am vegan. It just makes me so happy that he is so supportive of me, my choices, his own personal health, and the rights of the animals that suffer all day everyday just to please people’s taste buds.

vegan,ms3wqf,My_cat_yells,Accidentally converted myself to veganism for life,"I've been eating vegan for two months and now I realized this is what I want for the rest of my life, and I consider myself vegan now. 

The story is somewhat funny. I'm 17, come from a family living in a rural nowhere. Family's quite conservative and all. And basically, my mother started having troubles with her arm, which hurt a lot, two months ago. She can't do all the things she did before so my parents...Dumped it all on me. I'm the only girl and I have two brothers. Before that, it was my mother doing most of the chores and all, with me helping. Now it's me who have to do it all, my parents' words ""But even if we ask them, they won't do it, they'll do it wrong"". 

Ok.

Mind you my dad won't do shit either, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to make it suck. As I said it's quite a conservative family and for some reason my little brother had something specifically against vegans. Literally would make up obviously fake stories about ""annoying vegan girls"" at school that he dissed (he is 15, also I'm literally in the same school). My whole family is the kind that'd say ""Bacon lol"" if someone says they are vegan.

I'm the one doing all the cooking now. So we went vegan. They hate it by principle. They hate it especially when I make something good and they ask what's in it and realize it's vegan. Now they aren't fooled anymore and just say everything tastes disgusting by default. Mind you none of them have taken up cooking lmao. They have taken up snacking madly on junk food though. 

Looking for vegan recipes made me read more and more into veganism. And definitely convinced me slowly but surely. And I discovered lots of vegan alternatives to foods I used to love (though there isn't much vegan meat and whatever where I live lmao). 

I will be leaving to move to another city for university in about a month, and I don't see myself going back to my previous diet.",590329,1618582055,2021-04-16 22:07:35,481071,38,1

vegan,mrzbmf,Sea-District7185,My friends just mocked veganism and it just has me really hurt tbh.,"I don't know. I just need to vent to people who actually kind of get it because I'm in a really bad headspace with it right now. The whole thing really fucked me up. 

I have friends in a discord server. One of them I've known for about a year. The others are newer friends. The friend I know has always been very serious about immediately stopping any sort of mockery or bashing towards another person, and they've always been open minded, which is a quality in them I've always admired.

Well today, they bring up a certain controversial vegan activist in the chat, which is fine. I was a bit nervous because I was scared the conversation would go wrong, but these people are aware that I am vegan, and there are other vegans in the server as well. I figured that they could have their conversation respectfully, and chose not to participate. 

Well, it got out of hand. All of a sudden there's these "" Lol I bet \[activist\] is one of those vegans who xx"", and ""lol vegans like that make me want to eat a ton of meat"", and just things that were extremely offensive to me, especially because these people were having a completely different conversation with me in another channel while saying all of this.

Anyway, I finally said something, because it was genuinely giving me anxiety, and they just seemed like...more interested in telling me that I'm wrong than actually listening to me when I say that xx or xx is wrong and is extremely offensive to say. They essentially asked me why it was offensive, and I told them, and they told me I was wrong, and then when I said otherwise they just shut the whole thing down.

I don't know. I just feel..judged? Secretly? And also it feels very backhanded that all other mockery towards any group or anything is banned, but this was okay? Like maybe that's how they really feel about me? And maybe I'm not really wanted in that space either way. Which frankly, I don't want to be in spaces that treat me like that.

I don't know. It just feels really shitty, because I feel backstabbed. Maybe I expected something in the friendship in regards to a level of respect for my ethics and beliefs, because if I said something really offensive about a friend of mine's beliefs, I'd want to know so that I can apologize and make sure they knew that I understood how offensive that could be, and that I'd do what I could to ensure that sort of conversation wouldn't happen again.

Maybe I'm just selfish for expecting someone to alter their conversations around me. Its hard to say. I just feel really shitty and now my anxiety is a fucking mess. Anyways thanks for coming to my rant. I'm sure I'll delete this later.",590250,1618563931,2021-04-16 17:05:31,499195,0,1

My roommate who was previously vegan and vegetarian off and on has recently been eating meat, for the past few months. She keeps talking about how much “real chicken” has made her feel so much better and healthy and she ALWAYS brings it up with our other friends who eat meat, how she added chicken to her salad and she now feels “nourished” with the “local, free range” chicken she has. Our friends will agree and it feels like it was targeted at me, it feels like she wants me to eat meat and is pushing me to do so. 

I’m a very passive person and usually just stay quiet, but have sometimes made comments pointing out that she may think her chicken is all smiles and happiness on the farm but it probably isn’t, and she’s still consuming a dead animal, and the protein it offers is easily replaceable. She just starts going off on how she knows her chicken isn’t, blah blah blah. She also gets chicken and burgers while we’re out to eat and knows for a fact that that meat isn’t “sustainable” but says she mostly eats “local, free range chicken” or whatever the fuck marketing they have on it nowadays.

My eating disorder has gotten bad and I’m under a dieticians supervision and have stayed strong in being vegan but it feels like my roommate is constantly rubbing it in my face how much she loves meat now and how much better she feels while eating meat. Ive made it clear multiple times that I know I will never eat meat again (because it is legitimately disgusting to me) but she still persists.

I’ve been vegan again for maybe three months, and although I don’t feel like I’m at risk of stopping again I feel like it’s important to see the truth of the matter, to drill in my resolve. And I guess partly self flagellation for my selfishness. 
 
I suppose this seems like an unnecessary rant, we’ve probably all felt this way, but I cannot understand how this is happening. How can we do this? I care about the environmental aspect of all of this as well, but even if none of that was a factor, this pain and torture is abominable. If anyone has any belief that we should do good in the world and not cause harm, then you cannot support this industry. The disrespect we’re showing these creatures is like something out of Saw. It should not exist. 

I’m continually gagging and I’m only ten minutes in. I know all we can do is stop eating it ourselves, and using products, but that doesn’t feel like enough. I’ve always suffered from severe depression, but knowing what is happening in this very moment, and has happened for years, and will seemingly continue is making me sick, and hopeless. 

My family and friends don’t want to see, nobody wants to see this. Anyone with any power and sway in this world doesn’t seem to want to help either. Of course there are exceptions, but overall we’re just fucked. I’ll be okay I’m sure, this just feels like the only place anyone will understand. 

I feel hate toward the workers, so cruel and callous about it all. They can’t even treat the animals with dignity, they actively make their lives even more of a Hell. These beautiful beings only want food and freedom, and would, as individuals show us all the love our pets do. As I write this my cat is climbing in my lap to check on me, because he cares about me. I know if any piglet of calf were rescued they could bond just as much with me. 

I just wish I could Thanos style snap them out of existence. Maybe that’s cruel too, but it seems better than what they have. Ideally I wish they could live free lives, but what would that mean to a genetically altered beast that no longer has any part in the natural ecosystems. We alter the world with no regard for what could happen. And we deserve whatever we get because of it. It’s breaking my heart that we’re taking everything else with us. 

This rock will keep spinning when we’re gone, and new life will rise, but how awful that everything beautiful here may be lost before we make our exit. I love this planet, it’s gorgeous, with unbelievable conditions that allowed us all to thrive, I love the plants, the land itself, and of course the animals. I’m having a hard time loving my fellow humans.

vegan,mrnzug,NaviBelle,Words of encouragement?,"Hope this kind of post is allowed. First time posting here.

I’m several months into the veggie lifestyle. I’m personally loving it. I love the food I make. I feel great physically and emotionally. I’m healthier than ever. I no longer feel guilty for contributing to the mistreatment of animals or damage done to the environment. 

But... I’m feeling defeated af. I just want to share all the stuff I’ve learned over my, albeit recent, journey with others because I’m excited about it. I’ve read so many science-based books and studies, as well as watched a lot of documentaries about the harms of eating animals and animal byproducts. 

Unfortunately, people are so biased to eating meat and just blatantly misinformed about the evidence behind the harm of it all. I find myself trying to be as objective and science-based as possible, but I wind up getting into debates I didn’t want to get in. I don’t want to be *that person* who comes across as the condescending vegan forcing their beliefs down someone else’s throats... because apparently that’s just automatically how you’re perceived as soon as someone learns you don’t eat meat and care about the planet. Insert eye roll here. I just want to be an advocate without being too much. 

I just want to help other people. I wish I had known about all the health benefits to eating plant-based much sooner. I wish I had known the full extent about how even just drinking milk and supporting the dairy industry results in cows suffering. I was just blissfully ignorant I guess. But I really wish I had made the switch years ago. 

Anyways, any advice on how to not feel so sad and defeated about people just not caring about going plant-based? (Besides apparently never saying anything on Reddit, regardless of how non-argumentative I try to be; lol) I’d normally not care and let people make their own decisions and personal choices, but I just feel sorry for the animals that are innocent victims.",590043,1618520364,2021-04-16 04:59:24,542762,2,1
vegan,mrnwfs,No-kann,Reducing/eliminating cheese from my diet,"I've been a long-term vegetarian, mostly started because I didn't like the idea of complicated, emotional creatures like pigs and cows being factory farmed with little concern for their well-being. 

This stance has expanded over the years to include the obvious environmental argument for a reduced land-use impact on the world and reduction of the high greenhouse gas emissions that result from raising the billions of animals we slaughter every year. 

I haven't however yet went so far as to cut out animal products, such as eggs and dairy, especially as I can buy some of them from a farm near my house that has a  lovely sense of animal welfare. But after speaking with my roommates more about reducing our individual impacts, I decided to look closely at what the emissions are of the foods that I commonly eat, and, wow:

It turns out cheese, chocolate, and coffee account for the bulk of what's left of my food-related greenhouse emissions. The rough ball park is that my consumption of just those three products leads to about 500kg of CO2 equivalents being emitted per year. Equal to roughly what I emit from power consumption or traveling by bus/subway/rail. The rest of my food consumption combined probably only equals 200-300kg of CO2, with a lot of that being from olive oil. 

(Using the data found here:)
https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local

It's a tough sell for me, as I like practically every cheese and would put it on every meal in some way. Chocolate isn't a huge deal for me, and I've replaced coffee with some other coffee-like products made from wheat that don't have caffeine but do the trick for me. 

Probably I will take an approach to reduce my consumption, allowing the odd cheesy treat instead of having it be a very regular part of my purchases/diet. 

Anyway I kinda just wanted to think this through and type it out, happy to hear some (friendly) criticism, other non-partisan sources of info, discussion that isn't just expressing morals to each other, etc.",590042,1618520076,2021-04-16 04:54:36,543050,8,1

To leave this sparrow and its eggs undisturbed the villagers collectively decided not to Switch on lights till the eggs are hatched!

Karpuraja, who initially spotted the sparrow and its eggs said,

&gt;""Nearly 100 families are there in this region and around 35 streetlights are used here. One day, when we were passing by the switch board, we noticed that a sparrow had laid three eggs. We immediately took pictures of them and posted it in our village WhatsApp group, and asked people to cooperate and not use electricity connected to the switch box so that the eggs hatch and the bird grows.""

35 streetlights were connected to this switchboard but still these villagers don't operate this switchboard to avoid accidentally damaging sparrow's eggs.Even women who are usually worried about going out in dark decided to keep their fear away to help the sparrow!

Nowadays, it's rare to see sparrows in cities.

When cellphone towers in cities are getting increased for our comfort without considering their effects on sparrows , these villagers kept themselves in darkness so that sparrow's offsprings can see the light.

vegan,mrjmb4,Pedro303,Does milk consumption increase survival chances for the cow?,"I recently came across a YouTube video that I watched several times over. This was a question posed to sadguru jaggi vasudev on on the cruelty to bovines by consuming milk. Sadguru responded to the query saying that it is better if we consume milk because the alternative is worse for the cow and it would land up at the abattoir. Also if something is not useful to human society we do not let it survive. He provides the example of dogs being tied up or caged. If dogs are let loose, things could be worse for civilization, he argues. 
I see a point in what Sadguru says and am bit confused on the macro factors of going vegan. Wanted to know the community's thoughts.

vegan,mrf1ew,TylerJL19,The USDA are the biggest bunch of liars on this Earth.,"On the USDA’s official website, it states that you should be drinking 2 and a half cups of dairy milk every single day, even though it has been shown time and time again that there are serious health risks associated with drinking milk of a different species. Not only this, but they have an area where you can input your age, weight, and gender and they will tell you how much you need of each food group (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources, and dairy). I tried inputting my own information and it said I needed 2 and a half cups of milk. I then tried to put in the info for a 95 year old man who weighs 999 pounds, and it said I needed to be on a diet 1200 calories less than when I put in my actual information to achieve a healthy weight. In those 1200 calories lost, THEY WERE ALL LESS FRUITS, VEGETABLES, WHOLE GRAINS, AND PROTEIN SOURCES AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF MILK. 

No matter what data you put in with the excepted of kids under 9 years old, you will find they recommend the same amount of milk, whether you’re young or old, obese or skinny, male or female, it doesn’t matter, yet what does change is the amount of fruits and vegetables you should eat the more you weigh (which on the website they say is LESS). So obviously being paid off by the Dairy Industry, and they don’t even try to hide it. Never trust the USDA with any of their recommendations, because more than likely they’re getting paid to tell you something that is simply not true.",589888,1618494493,2021-04-15 21:48:13,568633,31,1

vegan,mr9e88,agarPlate25,Giving up on my dream,"I'm currently studying for a masters of engineering in biotechnology. I have a dog I love and I went vegan about a year and a half ago. Since then It's like my mind has opened and I can sympathize with animal on a much more intense and emotional level. Before, it was like my mind protected itself by turning it of. (got my dog a year ago).

About the dream: I started my studies wanting to research the brain and mental illness. I wanted to find what happens in the brain during therapy vs. medication. But as I'm in my fourth year, I'm realizing this won't be possible without animal experiments, and I don't think I can do it. I have found that I have an interest in bacteria (the good and the bad kind!) and I have gotten an internship this summer with a research group studying the plauge bacteria, and I danced with joy! Yet this morning I'm drinking my tea, eating my hemp seed toast, and feeling a loss for what could have been. I have  my own experience with mental illness and my best friend of 15 years have battled it her while life, and I was really wanting to make a difference in the field. I can't help but feeling a little weak, but the thought of spending my career experimenting on mice makes me want to vomit, flies were bad enough.

I don't know if anyone will read this, but it felt somewhat therapeutic to type it out. I hope you are all being safe and taking care of your physical and mental well being in these crazy times.",589799,1618469820,2021-04-15 14:57:00,593306,14,1

vegan,mr8d25,yoloswagggmoney,Y’all needa make a change.,"All vegans are obnoxious. Never has anyone interacted with a vegan for more than 5 minutes without having to talk about something related to health, animal rights, or that new vegan place that ‘everyone needs to try’. They steer the conversation towards it. Any conversation. 

Person: “Hey I like those shoes”
Vegan:  “oh thank you, they’re vegan leather because the factory farming industry is destroying the planet and I just can’t contribute to that.” 

No one enjoys mealtime with vegans. They are not fun to cook for because they ask too many questions about the food you had to go online to find a vegan recipe for; and they also manage to suck to go out to eat with as well. They either have to go to specific restaurants or they have to spend 10 minutes modifying something on the menu. The prospect of eating with them is a chore and it inconveniences everyone involved. 

Vegans use weird products and further vegan they go, the weirder the products they use. Some things used by vegans are okay such as essential oil diffusers, others aren’t. I’ve seen hard core vegans use natural deodorants, smelled them too, may as well have rubbed apricot and ass under their armpits. The worst I’ve seen was a coworker of mine with yellow teeth using fluoride free natural toothpaste.

Vegans act like their minute dietary change is ‘who they are as a person now’ and base their whole persona off of it; but that trait can primarily be attributed to one of the main causes of veganism, which is the lack of enough personality traits to make them interesting as normal people. This needs to stop. I like the idea of being vegan, I like vegan food, I see nothing wrong with veganism except for the people. It’s not a loud minority, it’s the lot. 

Just food for thought and don’t worry because it’s dairy free, gluten free, cruelty free, meat free, duty free, sulfate free, sugar free, free of gmos and pesticides, free of added chemicals and harsh ingredients, free of charge. Just all natural, organic food for thought. Anyway, goodnight.",589777,1618464698,2021-04-15 13:31:38,598428,2,1

vegan,mr7rc8,westvillagelover,Why are most vegans liberal / left-leaning?,"Genuinely curious, I’ve been vegan for years (I feel very strongly about it) and I consider myself a centrist. I’m not saying veganism is politically related, but I’ve just noticed that most vegans are liberal. I’ve also seen lots of conservatives completely trash on vegans.

I believe that veganism doesn’t have a political affiliation just as like how being against slavery doesn’t have a political affiliation. I’m really big on free thought, valuing facts over emotion (which conservatives constantly promote), and I view this as being 100% in line with being vegan. Ignoring animal slaughter and torture is the OPPOSITE of “facts over feelings.” If you feel so strongly about your love of meat and are willing to ignore all the facts that meat/meat products do to the world and to animals - then that is the definition of being ~too sensitive~

On the other hand I do think that liberalism ideology *today* is not very rooted in facts at all. The social change that liberals tend to promote going on now (feminism, racial movements, etc), in my opinion, has taken a dark turn don’t make a whole lot of sense when you look at the facts. I obviously support equality for all races, genders, sexual orientations, everything! But the ideological underpinning of what the movements  have become today is something I don’t necessarily agree with. And I just think they are so dissimilar from being vegan but are branded the same way!

And if you don’t care, then just say you don’t care but don’t brand vegans as being “touchy feely” when its tangible, harmful effects are supported by so much evidence.

I suppose that most of the correlation of how vegans are usually left-leaning is because liberals are known for being big on social change and conservatives are more adamant on traditional values. 

It’s just interesting to me, what do you guys think?",589768,1618461929,2021-04-15 12:45:29,601197,67,1
vegan,mr7m5d,Celeblith_II,I don't think this gets said enough: I love being vegan,"Non-vegans often talk about veganism like it's this big sacrifice, and I know that's how it seems when you're looking at it through the lens of carnism, but after being vegan for three years, I can honestly say that I love being vegan. 

I love the food. I'm moving to Seattle soon, and the few times I've visited there, I was blown away by the all-vegan restaurants. In 21 years living on Earth, I'm not exaggerating when I say the best food I've ever eaten in my life was from an all-vegan restaurant in Seattle (if you live in Seattle, you might know the place I'm talking about; it's in Greenlake 😉). But it's not just restaurants. Vanilla Oat Yeah is, like, my favorite drink. It's so delicious and I'm not surprised big dairy is scared of veganism because cow's milk was never as good as oat milk. 

I love the people. Vegans are some of the coolest people I know. Vegans are brave. You have to be brave to stand up to a cultural institution that's as huge and oppressive as carnism, to stand up to friends and family who constantly ridicule and question us. Vegans are kind. It shouldn't take a lot of empathy to realize that animals' lives are more important than humans' taste buds, but it does, and you can see it in the way vegans talk to and support each other and interact with animals and the world around them. 

Finally, I love the animals. When you think about it, not harming animals is such a simple and obvious thing, which is why we say it's the moral baseline. It *is* the  moral baseline. But I still love it. I love knowing that when I say I care about animals, it's not hollow and ironic. I love petting my cat and knowing that farmed animals have just as much individuality and personality as she does, and that I'm no longer supporting their torture and murder. So to all non-vegans, just remember: it takes nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal. And to all vegans: I love you homie",589767,1618461273,2021-04-15 12:34:33,601853,72,1
vegan,mr74wt,sandy_Mist,Ideas for snacks and lunches that do not come in plastics [or contain minimal],"Hello all, 

I am new to the vegan lifestyle (around four to five months now) and I have noticed the difference my body feels ( I have always believed in listening to your body when it comes to food). One thing I have noticed is the amount of plastics my food is coming in has grown seeing as some of the things I have been getting is either individually wrapped to ensure no cross-contamination (e.g. cheese) or comes in mass and is easier to come in plastic to carry them (e.g. blueberries). 

I have discovered a few things (e.g. chickpeas in oil that come in cans) and am looking at some inspiration for what else I can have for snacks and linches that do not come in plastics \[or contain minimal\] and ideas to replace things such as Ryvitas, corn thins and corn chips (this one has been the hardest as I love corn chips).

So I'd like some hot dogs that are very neutral taste. I'm gonna be putting ketchup and onion on it anyway. So it doesn't need alot of taste, it just needs to not taste bad or too much. 


Would also like minced meat so that i can put it in stew(?). Not sure if that's the right word, but like stuff you cook together and put on your rice..

This was one of the recipes that I got from here: [https://vegfaqs.com/vegan-seitan-recipes/](https://vegfaqs.com/vegan-seitan-recipes/)   


Instructions that I remember from the site:  
1. mix dry ingredients

2. mix in wet ingredients

3. knead by hand for 2 minutes

4. cut into small pieces and put in instant pot along with 1 cup of water

5. set instant pot to manual high and cook for 15 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I make this, I always find that it's really chewy and rubbery. Is it an issue with the ingredients or do I just need to cook it less or something? I really like the convenience of the instant pot so I've stuck with this ever since I found it since most of the other recipes I've come across don't use the instant pot.

Currently as the rest of my family is still eating meat, the fridge is piling up with it. I used to be the one eating most of it. I still see chicken and think it would be delicious, but I think I will have to balance things. Maybe eating chicken once a year our once a week would be ok. Back in the day we only had chicken once a week. For the past many years, this was every day we would have some kind of meat. But now I turn back and realize the thousands of little chicken and cows that had to be killed just for me to eat it. I think one a week or a month would be a compromise that most people could achieve without going fully vegan and ""missing out"". Lab grown meat sounds interesting, I do love a good burger....but at the price of a life? That makes me feel so bad.

vegan,mqxr29,Professional-Tree-40,Is being underweight always a bad thing?,"I hope this is a good place for this post. I’m 5’10”, 120lbs. I’ve always had a very slender build, long limbs, very gangly. I workout maybe 3 times a week, including light weight training, some running and dance classes. I have been vegan for about a year. I make sure to get around 60 or so grams of plant protein a day, and believe I eat a very balanced diet. My BMI is 17.5, which puts me in the underweight category. I was about 130 before going vegan, but a lot of things changed in my life to cause me to loose weight. I take a daily women’s multivitamin as well to make up for any lack of vitamins. Idk...I’m just concerned. I don’t have health insurance so going to a doctor isn’t easy. But I’m never sick, and I’ve managed to not get COVID and I’m a bartender so I feel like that’s a win.

vegan,mqxm43,life-uh-findsaway93,Vegan Baking Benefits,"There's obviously so many reason why vegan *anything* is fantastic (not killing animals, helping the planet, incorporating more nutrient-dense foods into your diet) but as a baker there is one small detail about vegan baking that just absolutely sends me, and that is the ability to adjust recipes to whatever size I want. 

If a non-vegan recipe calls for 1 egg and makes 12 muffins, but I am a) solo and b) don't need to be eating all those muffins by myself, those muffins either all get eaten by me (to my chagrin) or go bad, which is a travesty in its own right to waste good muffins. BUT, want to cut a vegan recipe in half? Into quarters? Want to make a SINGLE vegan muffin? Measure out less chickpea flour, or flaxseeds, or applesauce, or aquafaba - totally and easily doable, and reduces waste and frustration.

I forcefully drank it, as it  had already been maid, I didn't enjoy it a single bit.

I very very strongly support veganism and aspire to become an activist after my exams are over.

I live in a vegetarian home(religious reasons) they consider meat to be a bad karma, but then go on and eat milk, curd etc.

I am 17, live with my parents, will soon join college and become a full vegan.

After learning about veganism, I immediately stopped eating eggs, my brother followed(only my dad eats eggs) This was easiest move to make.

I need to study 10-12 hours a day, so I am not in any position to make my own food, I stopped drinking milk, eating curd etc.

Half of food we eat is already vegan by default But still, my family has to put butter/ghee on other half, I have to eat what has been put on plate. I don't even enjoy the taste anymore, thinking about all the exploitation.

I even tried explaining my family, who consider cow to be so called 'sacred' about the horrors of dairy industry, on one hand, they generously donate to cow shelters, on other hand keep using milk.

I can't even argue with them, it's peak time of my eams, and the'll say focus on studies not on this. I know my parents really love me and all, but this is just torture. I hope I soon join college and finally adopt veganism in a few months.

I feel jealous of you who align your actions with your beliefs.

\# If you suggest anything, please do realize that I have tried most things you can thing of, and it's not an excuse or a choice to be a vegetarian, I have to be one, if there was a choice, I'd became vegan a long time ago.",589577,1618422524,2021-04-15 01:48:44,640602,10,1

vegan,mqvik6,BlueDogBlueFrog,"To newbie vegans, from a newbie vegan","This post is also for people considering veganism, but are scared to ""take the leap"". 

I became vegan just 2 months ago, but I think this might help someone. 

I used to be a massive meat eater, just 2 months ago. Seriuously I couldn't rember going more than 1 day without some type of meat before going vegan (im serious). I used to proud myself in saying ""if it doesn't contain meat, its not a real meal."" Obviusly that was a joke, but there was truth to it for sure. 

The first week going vegan I felt absolutely miserable. I thought I would never enjoy food again. ALL of my favourite recepies not only included meat and dairy, but basically revolved around them. I was actually super depressed. I even made a post here lol. I remeber trying a beyond burger, and literally thinking ""yep, this doesn't taste anything like meat, I guess I am cursed to never enjoy food in my life."" Also cooking vegan bolognese fot the first time, and remeber trying it out and just throwing the whole pot away because it was gross.

Then for some reason, I swear to Zeus, after trying my second beyond burger (since the only way to get it was to buy the 10-pack) I was like ""what the hell, this isn't bad at all?"". Third time trying it, I was hooked. Its really bizzare, that it changed so quickly, but I remeber the first time the smell while it was raw (cat food, lets be honest) and grilling was foul to me. I still is, but when grilled, its godlike. Like serously, I make sure not to eat more than 1 or 2 every 2 weeks, since it isn't the healthiest food, but I would crush them and inject them in my bloodstream if I could now. Well made beyond burger with sexy lettuce, juciy tomatos, fried onions, spicy jalapeños, BBQ and chipotle sauce and baked potatos, oh lordy. Im a simple man, and thats a food orgasm to me. 

Also I tried to make a few adjustements to my vegan bolognese and it turned out extrenely delicious, literally the polar opposite of my first try.

What I wanted to say with this is don't get discouraged at the beggineng. Some things are different when it comes to recepies and it will take you some time to adjust. But I have to say, for me it changed super quickly. Way quicker than I would have thought. I haven't craved meat at all and I have never been a big cheese person anyway (I did buy vegan cheese for my bolognese and it was dope too!!). 

So if anyone is currently starting out, just because you currently feel like shit, doesn't not mean its your new ""normal"". Its NOT! Just experiment and check out youtube channels or articles. Trust me you are gonna find delicious food, and learn to make it. And this comes from a former meatholic.",589563,1618421376,2021-04-15 01:29:36,641750,15,1
vegan,mqv7eb,AdvanceDirective,Lab-grown meat as an ethical solution to industrial animal farming,"I haven't seen much conversation about this.  

It's very unlikely that we will be able to halt animal farming on the ethical arguments for reducing the suffering of sentient beings alone.  People want to eat meat regardless of the horrors necessary to produce it under current conditions.  

Aside from animal harm, we know that animal farming has led to zoonotic diseases that are responsible for virtually every pandemic in history, but that hasn't stopped us either.

If the biggest reason people don't care about the harms that animal farming has on people and other animals is that they just like the taste, then an actual cell-based meat would be the best alternative, right?

The problem is, this industry would have to compete with not only the meat industry, but also with plant-based industries.  I've seen the cost of lab meat go down drastically in 10 years, and really hope to see this alternative in the future, because it's probably our best shot at a healthier and more ethical future for people and other animals alike.

vegan,mqv0n6,Dantr1x,A potential warning on Vitamin D2,"I used to take Vegan Multivitamins daily, I may skip a day but it is usually 4 days a week on a lazy week.

However, my doctor just gave me my recent blood tests and told me I am still deficient for vitamin D, despite the supplements containing 1000 IU of vitamin D.

It turns out in vegan supplements they use D2, as vitamin D3 is not vegan unless absorbed organically through the sun. So I decided to do some research myself and it turns out:
[Conclusion: Vitamin D3 increases the total 25(OH)D concentration more than vitamin D2. Vitamin D2 supplementation was associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D3, which can explain the different effect on total 25(OH)D.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24001747/)

Unfortunately, I'm now taking vitamin D3 tablets until Northern England gets the sun back! Does anyone have any experience feeling worse after taking Vitamin D2? Does anyone know other vegan solutions I'm missing on?

vegan,mqu6ox,Sunset_Colours,The Seaspiracy backlash is so boring,"I wasn't vegan when Cowspiracy came out, so I didn't witness the backlash, but I bet Seaspiracy is experiencing 100 times anything Cowspiracy did.

100% of all the negative comments I've seen so far are people grasping at straws and detracting from the main message.

&amp;#x200B;

*'Some facts are inaccurate'* 

But the majority that are accurate are still painting a pretty horrific picture! 

&amp;#x200B;

*'Rural communities need fish to survive'*

Um yeah of course, they aren't the issue! You sitting at home eating fish three times a week are! As the director said  “The people that rely on those fish, the best thing we can do to ensure that they can survive – and that there’s enough fish for them to eat is – for us people who have the privilege to avoid eating it.” 

&amp;#x200B;

*'This documentary reeks of white saviour and of blaming minorities'*

The director is Iranian, and by far the worst images are from a bunch of white people using modern technology for their 'traditional' whale genocide day. I think its just blaming humans to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

*'Sustainable fishing is the only way to save the ocean'*

What are you even on about. That's like trying to save someone's life by stabbing them with a knife made out of 100% recycled material.  

&amp;#x200B;

*'Vegan alternatives are just as bad, they do just as much damage and take up just as much land'*

First off, no they don't. You only have to look at the percentage of land used to feed animals to see where most of the land usage is going. Secondly, demand leads to innovation. With our population boom, we won't be able to sustain any diet, let alone one that requires the mass production of live animals to feed us. I definitely think a large percentage of our future food is going to be produced artificially, including meat and fish.

Alright, rant over, I know I'm just preaching to the choir here but just had to get that off my chest.

I am not one of those people waiting for labgrown /ethical meat and eating regular meat in the meantime. This discussion was brought up in an animal-related philosophy class. If this discussion is too off topic for r/vegan, I'll take it down.

I think we all agree the reason that eating animals is wrong is because animals have the capacity to suffer. This means it's equally wrong to kill and eat a chip vs a fish, as intelligence is not directly linked to ability to suffer . What if, however , biologists developed a version of an animal that has guaranteed no ability to suffer? Either the part of their brain that registers pain and fear is turned off, or they actually enjoy being killed and eaten (like that one cow in HitchHikers guide to the galaxy's restaurant at the end of the universe). Would it be ethical to Breed this creature into existence in the first place? If we think meat eating on a human-wide scale will never cease, is it actually MORE moral to breed this animal into existence?

Cows are constantly impregnated so we can take their milk from them consistently. Their babies are taken away to either be slaughtered or used for their milk just like their mother. Since they are being constantly impregnated, the cows utters get inflamed and infected, which then causes blood and pus to be in the milk that we drink.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember a couple of years ago raw diets used to be the rage. Digestive issues of any kind? just go fruitarian. But their popularity seems to have died down and a lot of the YouTube guys that preached it have reverted back to more traditional diets.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm still curious on why it would work the way it does. Aren't these people ravenously hungry? I see a lot of endurance type athletes out of the niche that swear by the diets. I've heard it said that certain negatives (such as low protein) are actually a positive and that they had no problem building strength while eating only fruit.

There's a lot of talk about how they make you feel so spiritual and I'm also curious if this has anything to do with the diet

My toiletries seem okay and mention plant based ingredients but half the ingredients list is all chemicals beyond my understanding.

vegan,mqn3r5,Midheaven-in-Piscies,Vegans Who Feel Sorrier for Themselves than Animals,"I mean of course I honor people's legitimate boundaries, but I question people who won't go into wildlife or veterinary work or other work that directly benefits animals because they're traumatized by having meat-eaters as co-workers. Like wow, I have racists as co-workers so I won't help minority races because it's too painful? I'm also seeing this in people getting upset about environmental science about animal agriculture (like people in the hard science trying their best to stop the largest harms to both humans and non-human animals which are in fact factory farms and smaller farms where animals are specifically raised for meat) splitting hairs over backyard eggs. This overall lack of perspective within the vegan community doesn't help any real world animals and turns non-vegans away from veganism. 

I don't see plant-based doctors or major animal rights organizations promoting this mentality (to the contrary Direct Action Everywhere invites sincere non-vegans to their meetings and activism, only requiring community leaders to be vegan) and I think it's really toxic to act like vegans are all precious babies who can't be movers and shakers in the real world. I mean I wish some of these people would do something like write music or  books, create vegan products, or do animal rescue if they really can't stand dealing with the confines of reality. I don't grasp how you think you can help animals by hiding from facts. 

I'm totally prepared to have this post deleted or to be cancelled, I have bigger projects I'm working on for animals, I just feel a need to express this. I just don't think this attitude of personal purity or fragility helps animals",589450,1618393025,2021-04-14 17:37:05,670101,17,1

vegan,mqjzw9,Kissadog,Important post on vegan dog food,"not all dog food is good, some is really bad, I'm feeding my dogs vdog nuggets, after doing research it's extremely unhealthy for them to it being very inflammatory.

the oil in it is sunflower seed oil, which is extremely high in omega 6, which can be a huge problem for dogs on a vegan diet, it causes a lot of inflammation and it severely limits their conversion of ala to dha and epa (omega 3)


and this is why after switching my dogs to vdog nuggets they have become really itchy and keep biting their bodies.

Since vegan dogs are not recieving dha and epa (which either comes from fish or algae), and they're recieving ala Instead, then they would have enough omega 3 to combat the inflammation from high Omega 6 intake, which makes high omega 6 intake a much bigger problem for vegan dogs than non vegan dogs.

You can give dogs algae oil, but it's not necessary, it's better to switch them to a good vegan dog food that doesn't use a high omega 6 oil, then they won't have high omega 6 levels and they would also be able to convert ala to dha and epa.

Sadly, i have a 15kg unopened bag of vdog nuggets that they have to go through, so i may order them algae oil while they go through it so that it helps with their skin problems from the high omega 6 content in their dog food

Make sure your vegan dog food is good, not all are, and vdog nuggets certainly isn't good.",589415,1618378134,2021-04-14 13:28:54,684992,0,1

Not even to be a preachy vegan about it, this is just straight up incorrect usage of the word. People opt for euthanasia when they have painful terminal illnesses, I get my cat euthanised when she's old and suffering.

It's not possible to euthanise a healthy young bull, chick, or even an older layer hen (who is at least as healthy as she was when she was pushing out an egg a day), because by definition euthanasia is killing to end suffering.

But of course saying ""killed for not being profitable"" or ""murdered"" is much less clinical and merciful sounding than ""euthanised"".

And so I propose a new term for when omnis are too bitch to use the real word for their atrocities - euthanism.",589414,1618376971,2021-04-14 13:09:31,686155,3,1

vegan,mnqqfs,darkchocolatebreath,Advice needed: meat is putting a strain on my relationship,"Hi fellow vegans. I have been vegan for 3 or so years now and I never thought I'd have a problem with my partner eating meat but I'm finding myself feeling conflicted about this situation. 

Let me tell you about my partner. He is a young adult from East Malaysia and we have known one another for 3 years in a long distance relationship. One time early on in the relationship he sent me a very long list of reasons why veganism is not good, most of them were health reasons. He now has come to respect my diet and even supports my vegan page. He even sends me recipes now. I've never once said anything about his diet and simply stated that I'm fine with him just as long as he doesn't expect me to cook for him.

The problem I have with him is the insane variety of meats he eats. He consumes everything from pangolin, frogs, insects, jellyfish, crocodile, water monitors, frogs, pig insides... The list is endless, and of course he eats the standard pork, beef chicken and fish. He also slaughters animals when it comes to traditional native festivities. This as you might imagine is very hard for a vegan to tolerate, and I feel I am coming to a point where I might burst if he tries to describe to me what a squirrel tastes like again. 

I know it's not his fault I feel this way because I've never confronted him. And when I've shown discomfort he gently says he'll never let me see the slaughters and that I must understand it is just ""traditional"". And that this is how Malaysia is. It's the norm. I don't believe that it's difficult to go against the norm nor find vegan or vegetarian dishes there, having gone myself.

I want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how I can change his ways of eating but I don't know how to begin. When I ask my parents they just say I must respect that or leave him. I love him incredibly and want to show him how amazing veganism or even just reducing meat intake can be. Should I tell him to not talk about meat in front of me? Should I make him watch a documentary with me online? Advice needed please! I need to do something ASAP because I find myself disliking him so much at times, while trying to tolerate his diet.",587950,1618002511,2021-04-10 05:08:31,1060615,1,1

vegan,mnq7s2,haipoio,How Veganism helped my eating disorder.,"Ever since I was 12 I had issues with food. I always wanted to be thin but always found it difficult to do long term, I loved eating and I loved food. 

When I was 13 I went from a 22 BMI to 18 BMI in a little over a month because I was starving myself. People started to notice and I was basically forced to eat more until I gained the weight back. Later that year I started throwing up my food to avoid gaining weight. I would regularly pass out. 

When I was 14 I came across a vegan YouTuber and my first reaction was “how fucking stupid” but then after listening and looking at more vegan youtubers and eventually watching ‘earthlings’ I knew I could no longer support the meat or dairy industry. 

I went whole-food vegan. And after a few months I noticed I was at my desired weight (about 135lbs and 19.5 BMI) it took no effort whatsoever either. Months go by and I wouldn’t lose or gain any weight despite not looking at my calorie consumption and eating plenty of food. I also felt happier and had more energy. 

Fast forward to today I’m 22 years old and have had no issues with my eating disorder. I’m still at around 135lbs average and I couldn’t be happier. 

I know this probably won’t be the case for everyone but it was a really nice bonus to not supporting animal suffering.",587940,1618000931,2021-04-10 04:42:11,1062195,0,1

vegan,mnin9f,uponthelilypad,Veganism helps me stop binging.,"Unfortunately, I have been in a binge cycle since March 2020. Literally the only relief I had from it was when I was vegan. 

A few months ago I was watching a lot of vegan media on YouTube and I went vegan again (previously was vegan a few years ago) and it really helped me to stop binging!! It was such a great thing and I felt so good in so many ways. 

Then, after a while, I had one big binge and I ate animal products in it. It's been about 2 weeks of me not eating vegan again since then and it 100% just stems from me being unconscious to my truer wants and being out of control to the binging. 

My stomach has been in constant pain from the meat and dairy products honestly. I think it's incredible how once you stop something you realize what a strange ""normal"" you were accustomed too. 

I also quit coffee 2 months ago and I used to think I just naturally went to sleep at 11 pm-1 am but now I get proper tired between 9-10 pm. 
I feel like the same happened with animal products; I'm now really aware of how crazily they wreck up my digestion! 

Anyway, I need to get back on track so I'm buckling down today and going back to being vegan. I know it's an important thing to me for many reasons; the animals, health, human exploitation, and the environment.

vegan,mnhlqx,Sshortcakez101,Avocados and ethics - not vegan?,"I was inspired by watching Rotten on Netflix, and the subsequent research I did after that. 

The avocado industry has skyrocketed in the last 10 years, being marketed as a super food, trendy and a status symbol. 

With this boom, comes issues. Most of the US's avocados come from Mexico, where the industry has been contributing to habitat loss, climate change and loss of eco systems, as well as funding drug cartels. Who then, in turn, harass, kidnap and kill locals. 

Avocados are water hungry fruits, taking about 1000 litres of water to produce 1kg. In Chile, one of the main providers to Europe, local avocado farmers are being run out of business because they can't afford the water needed for their crops. Rivers have dried up, wells are drying up and the elite control the precious resource. I'm sure you can extrapolate what it means for the environment and human rights when the water drys up and is seen as a commodity, but those who have spoken up about it have received death threats. 

So what can you do? 

For Europe, buying the fruit from Spain ensures its traveled less, and ethically produced. 
For the US, its not that simple. Even home grown crop has its issues, because they need so much water, it contributes to the desertification of already arid states. 

Obviously, these options aren't perfect. The best you could do is decrease the amount you eat avocado, or stop altogether.

I am sure this question has been asked a lot before but I am looking for the best non-dairy milk alternative. I've been a vegetarian since I was 8 and I'm just now turning 21 and the main issue as to why I haven't become vegan is I cannot find a good cheese and milk alternative. I've heard good things about violife brand cheese so I am going to check that out (feel free to name other brands!), but milk is tough. I use macadamia sometimes for cereal, and the oat cafe style for lattes but all the other milk give my foods and other drink a weird funky taste.  I don't like cashew, and almond milk is bad for the environment (and just tastes kinda bland), and I wasn't a big fan of regular oat milk so   I am not sure what to use really. I am not completely opposed to buying a bunch of different milk but it would be nice to find a milk alternative that works with eveyrthing!

vegan,mndk9j,machineethics,Thoughts,"Look at the strain we have had to go through  to assert that person of x race is human. The suggestion that someone is not human is an excuse for catastrophic abuse, despite the suffering  they would clearly have shown and the obvious mutual traits between abuser and abused. Now consider that they are not, in fact, human - the  situation of animals is cosmically bad. The excuse *is the real thing -* the abuser can take the gloves off and hide all pretence to civility.  
It  takes huge human effort to discover or act on the buried abuse of  people by companies or governments. Think of chemical waste that was  found to cause cancer in a population only through the effort of  investigative journalists. Also think of the immense difficulty of finding some kind of justice for the lives ruined - an achingly slow  lawsuit, an eventual (and disatisfying) fine, no criminal charges and a probable CEO bailout.  
Imagine if the company spilling mercury in our water supplies, that stopped only because it was caught, was able to operate in complete secrecy and with the confidence that the harm caused was caused to the *inhuman.*  
If it takes this much effort to bring the mistreatment of humans to the surface, and to achieve the flimsiest kind of justice for *people*, try to conceive of the quality of life of the thing used as the *excuse* for human exploitation and maltreatment - the model for the exploitation of everything else.",587807,1617960816,2021-04-09 17:33:36,1102310,1,1

It didn't even cross my mind that the fur on it could be real. I assumed it to be obviously fake fur. My father also has no clue since it is a brand coat and he always buys brands so it was not on purpose.  
I was just bold to assume that real fur just isn't used like that without making it really obvious. So foolish. But now I am in a train with the coat on my lap and I was wondering if you could wash it so I was looking into the sign and there I saw that it is real fur. I feel so horrible.

vegan,mn9da6,General-Permission-5,Trying to become vegan but am being roadblocked by one thing - medicine,"The point I've come to is this:

I could never feel good about being vegan if I'm going to continue using medicine, so do I stop using medicine as well? 

For stuff like the common cold and whatnot, it won't matter too much. But for serious illnesses which everyone has to face at some point in their lives, stopping medicine could mean prolonged suffering and death.

So based on that of course I don't want to stop, I don't think anyone does, but if I continued using medicine then I'd be contributing to animal exploitation which defeats the purpose of becoming vegan to begin with. 

Ultimately, human and animal life are equal, neither one is morally superior to the other. So if I get sick, then the ethical thing to do would be to let myself get sicker and die. Why should I sacrifice an animal's life to save my own? But I don't want to get sick and die, so I'm stuck.  

Unfortunately, our medicines come from animal exploitation. This could very well change in the future, but at present this is what the situation is and I don't know how to deal with it.

Any tips would be appreciated.",587754,1617941847,2021-04-09 12:17:27,1121279,21,1

I personally started feeling worse on days after I'd eat tofu, and I'd eat things wayyy worse for your health than a bit of fatty tofu, and those things did nothing to me.

Plus you add in personal factors, if you're really low on vitamin D, and that calcium is not getting absorbed as it should.  Which is worse for your arteries.

It's crazy to think 200 calories of some tofu can have around 100% of your RDI in supplemental form.  Not natural calcium forms.  And people can eat easily 400-600 calories.

It's only concerning to me because people can each so much tofu that they're getting insane amounts of calcium.  And the worry is personal factors, having that calcium sit around in their blood, having that much calcium possibly affect iron levels even more (they compete with each other).",587747,1617939431,2021-04-09 11:37:11,1123695,10,1

Two days ago I left my lunch in a Tupperware container in their fridge. I forgot I had left that lunch there and packed another lunch to bring to work today and when I was putting that lunch away is when I realized I already had food there.

I'm pretty sure none of the blood got in, it was a closed Tupperware but is it weird that even after I cleaned it up I was still hesitant to eat it anymore....

It kind of grossed me out and I'm not usually one to waste (especially when the food is soooo delicous) but I can't get over the idea that there was a dead life leaking it's bloody juices all over it.

I was thinking of going and just asking for the vegan menu but I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’d still be eating a vegan meal but is wrong to give money to a restaurant that makes the majority of their profits from meat? Even if I’m not directly supporting meat/fish it would still be giving money to a restaurant that literally specializes in fish.",587685,1617921829,2021-04-09 06:43:49,1141297,12,1
vegan,mn2x6r,poeticVegan,[OPINION] omnis don't enjoy meat as much as they believe they do,"Now hear me out.

There was a study where people bribed $1 or $20 lied to say a boring activity was interesting. The people paid $1 changed their attitude so that they actually believed the activity wasn't too boring. This study shows cognitive dissonance in action. However, the people bribed $20 didn't change their attitude. This was because they could say that it was the money that made them lie, not themselves.

We all know omnis experience cognitive dissonance which leads to my question:

Let's say taste is the bribe to abuse and kill animals. If omnis say they love meat, then why do they have cognitive dissonance when the people bribed the higher amount didn't?

The taste they experience is actually not significant, it is only exaggerated by their cognitive dissonance to justify their actions.

Would this knowledge help with outreach, no. It is just interesting lol.",587676,1617919987,2021-04-09 06:13:07,1143139,5,1

vegan,mn119r,MurphysLex,overcoming a self identity crisis.,"tw: self harm, depression, eating disorder, general mental health issues.

i was a huge meat eater. i loved cheese and eggs. there wasnt a day, heck even a meal, without animal products. then one day, 4/8/2014, i watched earthlings and turned my nutrition upside down: fully plant based. i researched cruelty free products and avoided zoos etc. i have never felt as genuine and real and authentic.

i dont know what happened in 2018 but i completely lost myself. 

i started hurting myself again. i was completely burnt out. i started binge eating and purging. i ate until i was sick and then spent 3 to 4 hours at the gym. i compensated the pressure and anxiety with food and exercise. then i figured, i would feel sick faster if i ate the lifeless bodies of innocent animals and if i drank baby cow growth juice and if i scrambled some chicken period. so i started consuming animal products again...to hurt myself. every time i put something on my plate, i thought about the horrific process needed for this to land on my plate. it made me feel sick to my stomach. this was my new way of self harm. when my own blood wasnt enough, i needed my conscience to weigh heavily on me for having the blood of innocent animals on my hands.

after about two years of this mental torture to myself, i realized that i wasnt fine. i wasnt „just coping with thing differently“. i was hurting myself, either with the knife on my skin or with the fork on my plate. i mustered all my courage and finally admitted i needed help. i started therapy. 

a few therapists, and meds, and diagnoses, later, here i am. 

i found myself again. 

i am immeasurably sorry. i have betrayed my beloved fellow earthlings. i wouldnt say i have any regrets in my life...except for this betrayal.  

8/4/2021. i am with you, again, and forever.",587644,1617914567,2021-04-09 04:42:47,1148559,4,1

anyway, then i got them benovo, they don't like it at all, and I can't blame them, just by smelling it it doesn't smell nice, very bland and unappetizing, they actually got thin on it, and would barely eat it, ate mostly homemade food.

Then got them vdog nuggets dog food, they love it so much, probably the most out of all the dog foods, they did love vegan natural balance more than the meat based dog food i used to feed them but i think they love vdog even more than that.

The problem is that after switching them to it my dogs became itchy, one of my dogs, the male in particular has become super itchy and keeps biting himself.

the bag is almost over, in alittle over a month i think, usually the dog food lasts them a lot longer tho.

Anyway my dad already got another bag of it, i think i should probably have it returned, i wish i could find natural balance vegan dog food.

any experience with this?

I would like to keep my dogs on vdog but i would need to find a solution to the biting problem, is it some form of allergic reaction to one of the ingredients?

Firstoff, reading the threads, I hope everyone stays safe today under this bomb threat news.

I'm looking for a single availability or apartment/house to share with \[an\]other vegan\[s\]. I can pitch in about $800/month, but am flexible.  


I'm friendly, productive, social, respectful, clean, COVID-conscious and responsible. I can be outgoing as well as leave others to their privacy or parties. I enjoy hiking, cooking, listening to many genres of music (not honkytonk...), and being a helpful community member. I typically vape Cannabis, but would love the freedom to smoke it indoors as well. Currently moving from Frederick to be closer to the mountains, and ideally would love to find my own place or one with some like-minded people!  


My requirements are a private or strictly vegan kitchen as well as a private bathroom or one shared with only one other individual. I'd prefer not to live with couples, dogs or other noisy animals (love 'em, but I want assured peace and no dog hair). Cats and reptiles, etc. probably fine.

Hello to all you wonderful green people of [r/vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan)

First of all I want to say three crucial things:

\#1 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering. This is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non-vegan. 

\#2 I hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work. Let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that I will ever hear about what I do is my own voice. This post is because I'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me. This project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth, and I'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me. I'm doing this because this is what I would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world.

\#3 I hope to clarify that I don't sell anything, nor that I am going to. This post is not about trying to get people to WATCH my content. It's about asking WHAT the vegan community would like to see and hear more of. 

For the animals, together we stand strong!

\---Abstract/TLDR---

What kind of content would you, yourself, have wanted to see produced on YouTube? 

Is there anything I can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on YouTube? 

Are there any specific topics, questions, or things I can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals? 

Is there any suffering (vystopia) which people struggle with, and I can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on YouTube or otherwise? 

Any other questions, information, contact info about me, or anything else, please leave a comment. It would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you.

\---lengthy post with lots of details about who I am, where I'm from, what drives me and why I do what I do follows--- 

So basically what drives, and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy, and gratitude I get from just the simple fact of being vegan, from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that I live life, I'm sparing animals from being killed. That is what I fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community. I really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals. I want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious. 

This is what the brand I have created since November 2020 has turned into today. 

Metta Sutta Vegan Activism:

The name ""Metta Sutta"" is inspired by a Buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill, and it's something I really found inspiring because it's what we as vegans do towards animals.

This is what I've been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks (I've only recently started being active)

\*I've been active in Facebook comments on agricultural/vegan groups for the last month 

\*Me and my girlfriend started a podcast (Norwegian podcast) this easter - it's gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community!

\*I have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high-quality videos: mirrorless camera, professional recording software, microphones, website, ads, etc...

\*Recently, I started producing videos on YouTube. This will be my primary focus from now on. I'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself, which is a major reason as to why I'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism.

\*Recently started a Metta Sutta Instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos, quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals.

\*Recently became active in reddit (this account is 3 days old :) )

I know me posting this may be something that I regret doing ""too soon."" Still, I would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far, and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and, hopefully, find someone that would like to connect more with me. 

From the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind, we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging, and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat-eaters in more effective ways? That's my highest hope, and I wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this. I've read the book ""A Plea for the Animals"" by a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard and recently listened to ""The Joyful Vegan"" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. I find these books highly inspiring, and I want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format. And what I'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here, I would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively.

I'm trying to offer to create a place, a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity, and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it!

\---

A little bit more about me: I'm 22 years old, I've been vegan for 1,5 years now, and l live in Norway. When I first went vegan, I was met with so much resistance from family, friends, and the society around me, and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day, has been a really hard, but rich learning experience. What I really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing, as well as (hopefully) helping meat-eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice.

How our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds, at their stage of development, through the heart, in a way that's relatable, in my opinion. 

If anyone is interested in checking me out, I do have a website: [www.mettasutta.net](https://www.mettasutta.net/) \- although I'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet, it's under construction. Alternatively check out my youtube channel. I recently deleted all my videos from other channels, and reuploaded the best I've made thus far on my main channel ""Metta Sutta"". Some are English, some are Norwegian.  
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ)  
If there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far, feedback is highly appreciated.   


I will be actively responding to whatever does (or doesn't) come out of this post. I'm a little bit giddy, and nervous, but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this.

I'm hoping that I can use the responses I get from everyone in the r/vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how I need to align myself going forward, to better help the animals that are suffering every day! 

If there are any spelling errors, or there is some clarification that's needed, please let me know!",587586,1617906707,2021-04-09 02:31:47,1156419,2,1

As it turns out, facebook does not consider this to be hate speech. Is it not hate speech to attack someone based on their beliefs?

 TLDR for below: I basically use some facts from cowspiracy plus other bits of information I've picked up. I explain regardless of legitimacy of activism, it is the message we need to get behind.

Thing is, the post isn't getting any views and I was wondering if that site is actively supressing it. I was wondering if people can go to the site to at least just view the post, which might help it appear in peoples feeds. Here is the link:

[https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts) 

""For someone like me, this seems like a disingenuous question. Why does it matter if its false or legitimate encouragement? The message is definitely something to get behind, considering the large devastation caused by animal agriculture. The animals themselves suffer so much.

Don’t give me crap about plants are living beings too; that’s a double whammy considering, for example, that the USA has a population of 320 million and grows enough grain for 800 million people. Most of it goes to feed livestock. All that mindless consumption and cruelty just for our taste buds. The first sentence of your ‘plant lives matter’ manifesto should be “stop the animal agriculture industry”.

Incidentally, the implications for water consumption in the US are stark. The animal agriculture industry uses around 50 trillion gallons of water annually. To put this in some kind of perspective, 5% of water is consumed by homes compared to around 55% for animal agriculture. In fact, on a global scale, animal agriculture uses up to a third of the worlds fresh water. That’s woeful when literally thousands of kids die of waterborne illnesses everyday. Also, livestock covers 45% of the worlds land mass, having the biggest impact on species extinction and habitat destruction.

Not to mention animal agriculture being responsible for 18% of greenhouse gases, more than all of our planes, train and automobiles combined. Some estimates put this at 51%, when you combine all greenhouse gases of animal agriculture and its by-products. Additionally, compared to human waste, there is 130 times more animal waste produced in the USA.

We’re deforesting the amazon, the literal lungs of our planet, to make way for soy production and livestock. Before you even think about blaming vegans for eating butt-loads of tofu, most of that soy is used as feed for the livestock. Soy for human consumption from this area only accounts for about 6% directly. So much for soy boys, when you consider who is eating the most soy indirectly.

Then the health implications of meat and dairy. Heart disease, cancer, strokes, obesity etc. The Wests health care bills, especially the USAs, are spiralling out of control. And its not all to do with an aging population. Just take a look at blue zones where they consume much less meat per capita, they have more health in their long years.

Take this anecdote as you will but I know how real this is. One of my older cousins had a bypass operation two years ago at the age of 41. He took BP pills, had sky high cholesterol and ate meat all day everyday, 21 meals a week. His favourite was a nice fatty lamb curry with a few pints of lager down the pub. He wasn’t even that overweight.

Then the climate change impact of all this… if you don’t know about this, then where have you been? You can’t refute the claims of literally thousands of expert scientists on this matter (even if a literal handful of them claim climate change is bogus.)

Okay, I can concede that maybe Netflix has a target demographic which appeals to millenials and other youngsters. After all, millennials are probably the main drivers behind the veganism ‘epidemic’. But here’s the thing, millenial or boomer, Netflix or regular programming, legit humanity or narcissistic activism… people aren’t asking the right questions and we’re running out of time. A barren wasteland cannot support a single crop, let alone billions of humans and their monstrously expensive tastes.

Hang on, this is not only a disingenuous question, its quite frankly a callous question. I feel a little sorry for the person who asked it. I can at least be a voice for the massive, mindless cruelty inflicted by human society on the animals, the planet and most idiotically… **OURSELVES.""**

vegan,mmn078,Jacob99200,"Not Vegan, but I had an argument with a friend about eggs","Okay, so I’ve read and heard a lot of people discussing eggs. I had a friend who bashed me for having chickens and eating their eggs, saying it’s cruel.

Now I am not vegan, but I wouldn’t really have an issue becoming vegan, as in I don’t have some driven need to eat meat/animal products and more often than not I don’t eat any animal products just by chance.

Anyway, I have a Vegan friend, but I don’t know his motivations or anything about being a vegan. He was a lil mad at me for having chickens and eating their eggs.

The only reason I have chickens is because my parents rescued them. (We also have a turkey who was rejected from her flock, don’t plan on eating her and she has been accepted by our chickens)

Now I stopped buying eggs because I know how horrible egg chickens are treated and instead of buying cruelty free, I just treat my chickens humanly. They have a pretty big coop with room for everyone(Even the turkey) and a pretty big run that’s safe from the animals living around my house.

I make sure to feed them with good feed and any vegetables scraps I have, I sit with them basically everyday so they aren’t startles by me entering their coop, I did name them as chicks, but as they grew up they got less and less distinct. I make sure they’re comfortable and happy.

I do take the eggs they produce and eat them and give them out to family so they also don’t have to buy eggs from mistreated chickens.

Now, a lot of vegans hate this notion because it’s still an animal product, but isn’t being a vegan more about the cruelty and less about the actual by product? 

Like I am aware that chickens eat the shells of their eggs(I’ve read mixed things on the actually inside bits), so I usually crush up the eggs shells and mix it into their feed, but I also have a bag of crushed sea shells just incase

Basically my friend said I was still harming them by just owning them, but I really do treat them as good as my dogs and if I didn’t take care of em they would have either went to someone else who might not have.

Basically I’m wondering if veganism doesn’t include eggs because of cruelty or simply because they’re an animal product. Cuz my friend seemed pretty ticked, but I’m treating them well.

 I don’t really understand this, surely the best way to keep animals from going extinct is to treat them well keep them alive and safe? I do understand that supply meets demand so the more people that eat meat the more pigs or goats or whatever will be out there but surely the first thing you would do if an animal is at risk is stop sending them to slaughter houses?

vegan,mmj3fh,fadedstreetlight,Another dreaded protein question,"Hello, everyone!

I want to add a disclaimer that I’ve been vegan since December 2019 and I feel amazing. I am also an avid runner, and my vegan diet plus my exercise routine has helped me lose nearly 130 lbs. 

Because I exercise so much, I try to eat at least 100 grams of protein a day. I have recently upped my calories to 1700 and I’m considering even moving it to 1800 as I start maintenance.

I haven’t had much trouble getting to 100 grams of protein a day, but I feel like I’ve been able to do it by focusing on a few staples (tofu/soy, peanut butter powder, protein shakes) and not really eating a varied mix of fruit and veg. Most days, a banana is the only fruit I eat. I have managed to sneak in more veggies to my meals, but I could definitely eat more of a rainbow.

I guess my question is, with all my activity, am I eating enough protein, too much, or too little? I would like to vary my meals a bit more. I want to start eating oatmeal with peanut butter and banana in the mornings and not worry if the meal has a certain amount of protein. I want to start adding roasted potatoes or veggies to my dinners and again, not stress so much on if I’m hitting that 100 g mark. When I don’t meet it, I often opt to cut out veggies and add something like nutritional yeast in order to get to 100 g while not going over calories. 

I feel very good when I get 100 grams of protein or more, and it’s been so long since I ate less than that. I’m just wondering if I could be a little more flexible with that number and still maintain my fitness level for running.

I’m massively into conservation. I’ve spent years donating, supporting and volunteering for different organisations and considered myself an environmentalist. Hell I’m cycling from England to Australia to raise money for sea shepard -what a great guy I must be, right?

I’m a meat eater. I was raised as a meat eater and every meal I consume contains some sort of animal protein. I’ve even worked on several dairy farms in my life and seen first hand the conditions and yet I continue to eat meat. 

I’ve sat casting judgement on others for being environmentally irresponsible whilst continuing to eat animals which I now know has a net negative impact which greatly outweighs any time or money I have previously spent or donated. The house is burning down and all this time I could have picked up the fire hose but instead have been patting myself on the back for pissing in the house’s general direction.

I’m more looking at advice to stay healthy with this diet, as I’ve considered eating lean meats / fish as much as I don’t want to 

My allergen doctor told me that I should either do that or get on prescribed supplements for as long as I don’t eat meats/ eggs / etc.

vegan,mmbnib,RABakerCo,Florida state of emergency - potential toxic wastewater flood,"Florida is in a state of emergency due to a potential toxic wastewater ""flood"" from a collapsing 77-acre pond that holds about 600 million gallons of water, containing phosphorus, nitrogen, and small amounts of radium and uranium.

These toxins are primarily caused by making fertilizer, and while I enjoy veggies and grains myself, keep in mind:

1) In the United States, just 27 percent of crop calories are consumed directly — wheat, say, or fruits and vegetables grown in California. By contrast, more than 67 percent of crops — particularly all the soy grown in the Midwest — goes to animal feed.

2) Eliminating animal agriculture would result in a 75% reduction in overall farmland use and still feed the world.

In conclusion, feeding animals, to in turn eat them, is a woefully inefficient use of our limited resources. We could massively reduce farmland by eating the crops directly ... which would in turn massively reduce the need for fertilizer ... and then we might not have to worry that our houses might get crushed by tidal wave of toxic waste! Wouldn't that be nice!

vegan,mmb6cv,GlarthirLover33,"I live in an apartment, and the neighbor's dog won't stop barking. What can I do?","The neighbors above me have a dog who is CONSTANTLY barking during the day (that's not an exaggeration, it goes on literally all day, and I'm listening to it right now). I manage to tune it out pretty well, so the annoyance of the noise is not really a concern. What I'm much more concerned about is the wellbeing of the fuckin dog, for a few reasons:

1. Dogs don't just bark all day for no reason, right? Sure some are more rowdy and hyper than others, but it lives on the third floor of a building, what does it have to bark at that it can see out the windows?
2. The dog sounds choked. The barking doesn't sound playful; it sounds more like gasping and yelping, and sometimes it quiets down for a minute and instead I hear low, slight howling, before the barking picks up again.
3. The sound always comes from the same part of the apartment. I hear it much more clearly in one room than I do elsewhere in my apartment. 
4. The people have lived here for at least 5 months, and I have NEVER ONCE seen them walking a dog outside or even taking a dog out to go to the bathroom real quick. My roommate, who hasn't been working for the last couple months and has been here a lot, has also never seen or heard any sign of the dog going outside.

I wouldn't have thought much of it until I realized those last two points. Would it seriously be possible that they're keeping the dog in one of the rooms and not taking it outside? If so, how the fuck do they deal with the dog going to the bathroom? I have no sense of smell, but my roommate said she doesn't smell anything suspicious. I just don't wanna take any rash actions. I knocked on the door upstairs and the guy answered but he spoke almost no English, I think he thought I was just telling him to keep his dog down. I don't wanna call animal control because I'm worried they will just euthanize the dog or some shit, seems like most organizations are always so quick to do that. I think my best bet is to ask the property manager if they could just go in there and take a look at things, but that might also result in animal control coming. Are there types of animal control places that I could contact that would know how to better deal with this situation? Or should I just assume the dog is okay and just leave them be? I don't know what to do, so I'm turning to my fellow vegans.",587238,1617827257,2021-04-08 04:27:37,1235869,11,1

Personally, I like to date someone with similar views on animal use. So myself and a friend recently created a new vegan (also allows vegetarians currently) social dating app and would love to hear your thoughts on it!

The app is still relatively new and we only launched Jan / Feb this year so we don't have many users right now, but are growing slowly each day.

Looking at peoples feedback regarding other vegan dating apps having bad interfaces, poor design and bugs we have tried to take this onboard when creating TofuTogether. 

The app is mostly free with a few limits on swiping (5 yes swipes a day, we also think this helps reduce spamming right/ yes swipes) and feed posts (3 a day). We wish it could be entirely free but then we would have to secretly sell your data 👀 or put adverts in to sustain the costs. People you have matched with are entirely free to message.

**If you have any feedback on the app, bugs or features you'd like to see added, please let us know as we'd really love to hear.**

vegan,mm7r5v,DocJive,Lets talk about Hunting,"Disclaimer: I am not actually vegan, and don't ever see myself being vegan. I can understand the benefits of vegetarianism and could one day take that route, but currently believe veganism is actually ethically counterproductive. Thats a discussion we can save for another time.  

Anyway, I was having a debate with my significant other the other day about hunting. This isn't pertaining to illegal hunting, poaching or any form of hunting that actively kills an already diminishing species. This is more in regards to sport hunting and other legal forms of hunting. My significant other is vegan. 

So, anyway, I personally feel as though hunting isn't as bad as it is made out to be. My SO felt quite the opposite. She basically stated that killing any animal under any circumstance is one of the worst things you can do. Although I do agree to some extent, I do believe that there is a lot more to take into consideration than just the death of the animal. In particular, I made the argument that sport hunting and the industry actually does bring about a lot more good than people realize. A lot of hunters pay for permits, and in some cases of big game pay thousands of dollars to kill one animal. This money is often put back into the land used for preservation purposes as well as funding security for those animals which are often poached. The documentary Trophy discusses this particularly well in my opinion. If if were not for this money put back into preservation, I believe that a lot of forgotten land would be taken advantage of by big business for development purposes. Additionally, in the case of invasive species, it can actually be beneficial to hunt those animals as to preserve the indigenous populations. My SO, however, did not feel the same way at all. She said that no matter the circumstance hunting is ethically wrong and should be looked down upon.

At this point, I decided to bring up the famous ethical trolley problem. Instead of giving her the situation using people, I instead used deers. Would it be okay to kill 1 deer if you could save 100 deers from death. She was very turnt off by this question. She first tried to say that she would not make that decision but would rather die before making it at first, until I pressed her. She eventually landed on not killing the 1 deer because she could never be the person that determines the death of an animal. I thought this was a bit of a cop out and explained to her that one would then assume that she is basically letting the other 100 deer die. She argued that it was a ridiculous scenario and not one that can be related to ethics at all. That i should not have brought up that situation when discussing animal activism. Oh well.

Anyway, my point was to say that hunting, legally, may result in the death of a few animals but at the same time it could bring money to help preserve many more animals and environments. Ultimately then, if done correctly, hunting wouldn't be so bad and instead could have positive benefits. Especially since it is already so hard to fund land preservation and hire lawyers willing to fight against big businesses for this purpose. Anyway that was a brief rundown of the discussion at hand. I know she values the opinion of this community so I am posing the question to you guys. What are your takes on hunting?

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate the time you've taken to read this post, I know it's a long one. Look forward to some good discussion.",587163,1617817877,2021-04-08 01:51:17,1245249,28,1

I still ate eggs and mozarella these last days as it is possible I do vegetarism or sometimes fish. No clue.

But does these symptoms make u think of a possible huge detox reaction ? (As I said I also have other health issues .. Lyme, deficiencies, stress, ptsd, perhaps still b12 issues or iodine, and low coq10/omega-3, histamine intolerance..)

Whole body burning intensly, spleen tickling burning too, liver tickling burning too, toxic gut feeling, very many emotional issues, burn out, insomnia, fed up by everyone, heart issues, lung issues, basically every organ, greasy skin, very disgusted by meat.

I also am on benzo wirthdrawal so a lot of stuff hete but if anyone had a detox from meat maybe it would be more simple to tell me your symptoms as mine overlap many health issues !!

We get our B12 by fermented foods right ? It doesn't make any sense to me to be supplementing as it is created by b13/orotic acid right ?

I was wondering about something...
I have been vegan for about 3 years and vegetarian for about 10. I grew up in Blowmaha Nebraska and moved to PHX about 3 years ago,  right about the time I became vegan. It was difficult but not impossible to not eat meat in the middle of beef country, but I'd say pretty much impossible to avoid things like butter and eggs in sauces and such. Much easier here in the Land of Produce :D
Anyways, I'm 6'10"" 360 lbs and I've never really been into fitness or exercise. I hate to use a cliche, but I truly don't have the time for it. I recently went to a gym with a friend of mine and I figured what the hell, I'll give it a go. Im not really in the best of shape, especially as a vegan. I feel great and my bloodwork etc are all good, but I can't seem to lose any weight. Too many grains and beans, which my system doesn't do so hot with. 
At the gym my friend had me lift weights with him. He said we could do reps to figure out the max rather than overdoing it and likely causing an injury. I maxed benchpress at 375, curled 110, and legs 2000.
If I wanted to really get into this, is vegan food going to be enough calories? Like I said beans and grains don't do very well for my guts, and f&amp;v have hardly any calories. That leaves mushrooms and nuts and avocados...
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I think it would be best to focus on the ethical arguements before going onto environmental ones in another film another time. Earthlings is the only vegan documentary I've seen, or at least was able to watch up to a certain point. The problem that I have with Earthlings is that it opens with the pets segment, which I personally find one of the most distressing parts, but my partner already agrees in adopting animals, so I'm concerned we may not make it to the segment on animals used for food, which is the main bit I want us to see. There's also the issue with the footage being older and I believe mainly from the US, which opens up for false rationalisations that the scenes are irrelevant to our situation. The other documentaries I know of are Dominion and Land of Hope and Glory, which I think would be good since it's set in the UK where we are, but I'm not sure. 

What suggestions do you have? Which film do you think is the best to promote veganism? Thanks.",587075,1617798246,2021-04-07 20:24:06,1264880,12,1
vegan,mlz85l,da_aundare,Watching Movies,"This post may seem strange to a lot of you, but it is something that is in my mind for quite some time now. I don't mean documentaries or educational films, but movies we watch for entertainment and how becoming vegan has affected my perception of those.

Let me give you an example: I consider ""Forrest Gump"" as one of the greatest movies ever made. The story, characters and music are just phenomenal. But since I stopped eating animals, I just hate the whole Shrimp Boat arc, especially the scene where they start catching them big time. I think it is safe to assume that those were real shrimps and not just props. Would it make a difference? I mean, I had no problems killing whales in AC: Black Flag as I had no problems with killing humans there, too.

Now of course I know that this world is not vegan, the people I interact with and I rely upon aren't vegan (well most of them aren't), and most (song)writers and movie makers aren't either, and I still like their products. And I'm not really someone who needs a ""safespace"" to escape from this (not judging if someone does!), but scenes like the one I mentioned are just reminders that most people who watch them don't even consider this wrong or something.

So I guess I'm just curious if some of you have ever given things like this a thought or if it doesn't really bother you. Peace out.",587044,1617791821,2021-04-07 18:37:01,1271305,9,1

vegan,mlwssy,ProdicingWithPurpose,All Quality - No Sacrifice,"I promise not to spam this group, but with so many people from the vegan community collected in one place, I can't bypass the opportunity to share what I have been working on for the last year...

After 15 years of being vegan, I feel like our food options have advanced exponentially over the last 5 years, but I personally have found vegan and ethical fashion to still lag behind in terms of design and overall style. (At least to my taste!) 

So with that, I was lucky enough to team up with a couple of vegan co-founders to work on a new brand, which we have launched today. Introducing **Nōskin**

Let's be honest - spending a year in design and manufacturing, selecting our suppliers, and finding fabrics such as recycled Japanese denim and hemp blends does not come easy, and does not come cheap - but I truly believe our community is ready to embrace, and demand, an improvement in our clothing options - the way we have with food. 

We launch today with a small product line of footwear, outerwear and (pre-sale) denim. I would really appreciate if you could show your support by following our instagram: @ [noskin.co](https://noskin.co)

vegan,mlwmk1,Den-Ver,Synthetic meat/ cultured meat is NOT vegan.,"Synthetic meat still comes from animals. Although we don't get them from slaughter, it's still not vegan.

That doesn't mean it's bad or morally questionable (?)

This is the thing I'm wondering about. If artificial meat becomes the norm, it's a huge step in the right direction, but it might not bode well for the main concept veganism (abstain from animal products) in general. Does this mean, in the future, it's acceptable to refuse veganism as long as you don't contribute to slaughter?

Or maybe you think synthetic meat is vegan; if so, I want to know why you think so.

P.S. I'm not saying we shouldn't welcome artificial meat. I'm merely wondering about the definition of veganism, and what it means to become one in the future.",586995,1617779674,2021-04-07 15:14:34,1283452,10,1

However, I want to ask y’all, if you have experienced any problems with your body due to tofu and other soy products? How often do you consume soy products? And is there anything else you’d like me to know about soy products?",586948,1617768099,2021-04-07 12:01:39,1295027,10,1
vegan,mlssf8,communitytcm,Alpha Foods: is it really vegan?,"So, I tried these, the packaging said vegan (honest - didn't have my glasses on at the grocery store, and saw all the rave reviews on this site), and then I read, ""natural flavors"" in the list of ingredients.  They also list, separately, ""vegan natural flavors"".  So, I called them.  

The rep I spoke to told me he was a 40 year vegan, that they were vegan certified (after watching seaspiracy, I am even more skeptical of ""certifications""), and that it was probably a misprint, and also that he would send an email to someone to figure out the mistake and correct it. 

All great, until I asked him to contact me with the particulars of his findings.  As in, what is the difference between natural flavors (read: chicken) and vegan natural flavors; and why they listed both. I am no dummy, I have been doing this for 35+ years. It is well known in the vegan community that 'natural flavors' is a massive red flag. Labeling laws are there for a reason, and companies do their best to hide information that might appear off-putting to potential consumers. And packaging isn't cheap - companies need to buy a minimum of 80,000 lots to get a small break on the printing of plastic; to not proofread ahead of time with this large of scale seems a bit off. 

So, this is where the rep seemed to get defensive: ""can you email or call me when you find out what is going on with the labeling?"" response: "" I already cleared that up.""  I pressed him a little more, and realized that he was not being cooperative and that I was wasting my time.  he cleared up that I was confused, which is bs, because the confusing label is why I called in the first place. 

I have NEVER seen labeling like this ever. There is a reason they listed flavorings twice, with 2 different headings.  I am not sure why. What are 'natural vegan flavors', ground up vegans?  the packaging says vegan, but there is no sign anywhere of an oversight body, company, or whoever declared them to be vegan. certified by whom, exactly? 

I really want to believe the rep I spoke with, but the defensive posturing and refusal to clear up the confusion - or rather write it off as "" probably a packaging mistake"" and refusing to follow up smells like trouble.  If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, is labeled like a duck, and tastes like a duck...

My hope with posting here is to get help pressuring them for an answer, in writing.  The rep may very well be on this forum.  I look forward to hearing more.",586934,1617764635,2021-04-07 11:03:55,1298491,0,1

vegan,mlqzze,veganactivismbot,We need YOU to help us train an intelligent reddit vegan bot! 😱🐤💕,"Hi vegans of reddit!

The [Vegan Hacktivists](https://veganhacktivists.org) are working on a reddit bot using machine learning/AI which can be called to respond to debunk certain vegan myths. 

# Hasn't this been done before? 
It has indeed! [/u/YourVeganFallacyBot was created a couple years ago]( https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/igyqbq/two_years_ago_i_created_the_yourveganfallacybot/) 

Sadly, this bot has gone inactive as it required the creator to manually approve all posts.

/u/animalsupportbot will use MUCH more sophisticated methods of detecting vegan myths with the aim of running completely autonomously. This bot can be summoned to respond to any vegan myth you see on reddit, drastically reducing the time vegans take to respond to run of the mill arguments.

# We need your help! 
## Labelling 
Although the bot is in a semi-working state right now with no training data, we really want this bot to perform better, and to do that, we need some reddit comments to be labelled. We've scraped around 18k comments from /r/antivegan and /r/exvegans and put them in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDue0zd00dYg0uaygXieDAJqFan4h1rSrNidQKQVz8A/edit#gid=0) for us to collaboratively label. For each comment in the spreadsheet, we'd like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. 

[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) 

In most cases, the comments will be ""N/A"", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the ""Key Sentence(s)"" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I'm not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) 

## Arguments/Responses
If you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn't present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you're willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. 

# Can I test it out now? 
Yes! You can check and test out how well it's working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It's good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) 

# How does animalsupportbot work? 
This is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn't mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ 

# What arguments can it respond to? 
Currently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone's favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)):

vegan,mlqbmd,its_spoopy_time,Addressing the graphic depictions of NH animal abuse.,"I see it more and more. People post pictures of graphic depictions of NH animal abuse without any sort of tag or filter.  These images are triggering in nature, and while they have a place to be shown, should be enforced as having to be tagged as NSFW.

I'd go so far as to say that it is actually speciesist for us to not treat the victims in these images with the same respect that we would a human. When the image of a human is graphic, we acknowledge the graphic, triggering, and disturbing nature of the image by tagging it as NSFW. When we post the same images towards NH animal abuse, however, we often leave

Now some may say that one could just look at another sub and leave this one, but its written well in the rules, under ""nonvegan posts"":

&gt; Do not under any circumstances post content, such as recipes, food pictures, news, cross-posts, and so forth, which include, glorify **or display the result of animal abuse, exploitation or cruelty**. This may result in an immediate ban and posts will be removed. 

I acknowledge fully that this rule exists, but I feel like it is being reinterpreted based off of the bias that if the image is technically ""pro vegan"", or if the images are somehow spun in a ""pro vegan"" way, then its seen as okay.  It really isn't, especially when you're dealing with such triggering content that often goes untagged and unflaired.

If I'm going to bring up a problem, I like to propose solutions to go along with it, so these are mine:

* Make the rule regarding this content its own rule, rather than falling under the category of ""no nonvegan posts"". This would allow us to report with the correct context, especially because a post can technically be pro vegan yet still break the rules.
* Specify in greater detail what is considered by the mods to be ""graphic images"", and under what context are they or are they not accepted, and how they are to be responsibly posted.

I'm not saying this is exactly what has to be done. I just want to start the conversation. I'd also really love to hear the voices of other people too on this, including mods.",586900,1617756500,2021-04-07 08:48:20,1306626,7,1

vegan,mlmtub,danasiamitchell,Not a true vegan,"Please, please, please read everything I say before judging me or the title; give me a chance before you downvote and ban me. So I've been having moral conflicts and it's really bothering me. (Disclaimer: I became vegan for the animals, and I am, in no way, claiming to be a victim. They are the victims, only them. I am simply making my point and asking for help on the matter, because I am seriously at a loss.) I now look at meat completely different (it's just flesh from an animal that lived a very short and horrendous life). But when it comes to dairy and eggs, I cannot seem to look at them the same way. Now, before you scream at me, I am fully aware of the horrors behind the dairy and egg industry, and I am in no way justifying what happens to these animals who deserve a fulfilled life— eggs and milk are unethical period, no matter how it's done.) What I am saying is that, though I oppose animal use of any kind, especially dairy, egg, and flesh industries, I find myself still being inconsistent. I don't like it. I just never see the mother getting her baby taken away everytime I see there's milk in a product; maybe it is because I am a selfish human being. I do not drink milk nor eggs, but sometimes I get lazy and I don't bother to check ingredients, or I eat it anyway even when I KNOW it has these products. Please, as I said, I want to change and be more proactive for the animals, hate comments are not going to help. It would really help if someone could give me some insight before you start saying, ""Oh, well you're not a vegan then — you're plant-based."" I am not ""plant-based,"" and I want these animals free just as much as anyone else. But I find it hard to stay committed because I am just lazy and, as I said, I do not feel the remorse as I do with meat, and even real eggs, and real milk. It seems likes it's an effort and selfishness issue on my part. Please tell me SOMEONE has got to relate to this at least a little bit. I know I love these animals, so why am I doing this? Why don't I see it as much as with humans or dogs and cats? I feel like society's stupid norms will never escape me subconsciously, and I will never be able to fully see it. But I don't want that.

vegan,mlmh0d,xboxhaxorz,"If you are an ethical vegan become Buddhist or Jain and get more rights, or create new religion?","Buddhist or Jain followers tend to have a vegetarian/ vegan diet, in most countries religion has a lot of power in regards to your rights. While Buddhist or Jain followers are not strictly vegan, religion is flexible and some can consider vegan the right way to do things and vegetarianism as not enough. The same way some Muslims consider certain things halal and others arent.  


Many of us are required to do certain things that we would not be required to do if it was against our religious views. This is the simplest thing for many of us to do now. Its not lying if we become followers and simply dont do anything else the religion requires. Muslims consume alcohol but they are still Muslim, Catholics have relations despite not being married but they still Catholic, so if we become Jain, etc; and simply dont follow all the rules we can still identify as Jain.  


This would help people in prison, military, educational facilities where we are required to do experiments in order to pass classes, jobs that have us do unethical things etc;  


I also think veganism would have more opportunities to grow if it was a religion itself in regards to all the complications that corporations create in regards to product labeling etc; and other issues that i might not be aware of

vegan,mll9yi,naeramarth2,"Cognitive Dissonance, Seeking Empathy/Guidance...","I’ve been watching a lot of CosmicSkeptic (Alex O’Connor) on YouTube the past few weeks. For those unfamiliar, he discusses a variety of topics, notably theology and philosophy, but touches on veganism quite often as well. 

It’s fair to say that until recently, I never really gave the concept of veganism much thought, as most people do, or rather *don’t* do, I suppose. To get straight to the point, I’m experiencing some personal struggle in this regard. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same. I guess I’m seeking some guidance in my direction from here. 

I think there’s strong case to be made for veganism on moral grounds in regards to the suffering of animals; notably, I have a problem with the current state of the food industry. This is largely propagated by a life changing awakening I’ve had in recent months, that paints a much bigger picture. I won’t go into too much detail on that for now since it’s not 100% applicable, but briefly: I am experiencing a growing resentment for the total reliance on the modern system we’ve been set up to live by, and only by it (that being big industries and corporations). This includes, especially, the food industry.

So on the topic of the meat industry, our population numbers have increased so much in recent centuries that we no longer have a need to hunt for food. We breed and manufacture animals for the sole purpose of eating them, and often times these facilities lack proper oversight, you’ve seen the videos of the undercover investigations. It’s horrific. It’s unnatural. 

So where do I stand in all of this? I feel a growing guilt for consuming manufactured meat. I could simply stop eating it, but it’s difficult to do when I’m surrounded by people who do eat manufactured meat and have zero problem with it. As it stands, I recognize our omnivorous nature, and I recognize the natural state of the world. There’s always going to be an impersonal, uncaring, necessary balance between predator and prey. That said, I don’t think I would have a problem with consuming meat, so long as I am the one that hunts, and does so correctly so as to not cause any undue suffering to an animal. I also don’t see a problem in utilizing an animal’s resources as long as they don’t suffer in the process. 

This is a process, so please don’t bash me for holding these opinions. It’s why I’m here, to seek knowledge, understanding, to think things all the way through, free of fallacy, and most importantly, to be the best version of myself I can be. 

Thank you for any input you have. I love you all -",586827,1617741860,2021-04-07 04:44:20,1321266,14,1

vegan,mlih69,Jeremiah-----,What's the alternative to cows on a farm?,"I don't see any way cows can just be let roam free. Cows can only be in a field for a couple days before the grass is used up, if they're not managed they won't get enough grass. If they are let to roam free cows will be breaking into peoples land, running on roads, in peoples front lawns to get grass. 

Also what do you do in the winter? In temperate climate countries grass doesn't grow in winter all the cows would literally die they'd have nothing to eat. They are completely reliant on farmers to feed them in the winter. 

Also think about newborn calves. Besides the fact cows need help sometimes to calve, when they are born they would not survive the nights in autumn, winter or even spring as those nights are cold. And again you have the problem of if the calf is drinking the correct milk, too much or too little. And new calves easily get sick they need different supplements which they wouldn't get.

Also even if those calves survived, in a couple years you have a bunch of bulls running around freely. Bulls are dangerous.

All of this needs to be managed. So they need to be owned by a farmer on a farm. I don't see how they can be allowed to roam freely.",586772,1617734193,2021-04-07 02:36:33,1328933,13,1

vegan,ml5zrd,GuiltyPapaya1456,A very sad situation; A call for advice.,"Hello everyone, thank you in advance for taking the time to read.   


We'll cut straight to the chase here. I recently accepted a new job (I am a bartender) at a bar which has been absolutely great, although the building is rather old. Why that's worth bringing up is because it allows the entry of at least several mice. You can probably imagine the attitude towards them harboured by the nonvegan management (who are honestly good people, just not ones who happen to be vegan).   


I am vegan myself and love animals. But, I am also aware of the sanitation issues they present in this case, which are made even more pressing in an environment such as a restaurant or bar, so I am really torn on this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

The management has set up traps around the place, which is painful enough for me to see, but my biggest point of contention is that they are using glue traps to get the poor little guys who just wanted to come in from the cold and eat some pub food (don't we all?). I am sure I don't need to tell you how horribly and gratuitously cruel those things are.   


I am just wondering, as a vegan, what is the course of action I should take that best balances practicality and compassion? I know welfarism is seen by many vegans as a tepid half measure against animal suffering, which I have nuanced feelings about, but maybe I could at least get them to use a quicker acting trap, or ideally something much much much more humane in place of that horrendous way to die. Only catch is, nobody else there is vegan, and we all know how much people traditionally sympathise with mice (or the idea of doing anything a vegan says), so I feel like this will be an uphill climb. Furthermore, I am, as I said, very new at my job, and I must admit I would ideally like to evade being labelled as 'that guy' who gets a new job and then feels entitled to tell the management how to run their business. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I have forgotten pertinent details, but that's all I have for now. Feel free to ask for any clarification you may wish for and I will comment back. I don't know what to do, but I feel as though something absolutely must be done. Thus, I turn to you, my fine vegan comrades, to give me your kind and rational perspectives.",586521,1617693348,2021-04-06 15:15:48,1369778,7,1

vegan,ml3hqw,ghown1365,Not all vegan chocolates is cruelty free.,"If you count humans as animals and your going vegan then you should know majority of cocoa is produced using child labor and those children are abused. Nestle, Hershy's, and Mars bars get there cocoa from those areas that use slavery. So KitKat vegan bar still probably got there cocoa from child labor areas. And some 'vegan' chocolates get there cocoa from there too. I'm not vegan myself but just warning you. 

And I know vegans feel horrible when they eat something that involved cruelty. But it's just that it seems like vegans, and vegan brands ignore that some food that is vegan itself is sometimes non vegan produces by using slaves. If vegan brands say animal cruelty free it might not be true. Humans are animals too. It's surprising to because peta promotes chocolate vegan brands and some of them get there cocoa from the areas the use child labor. I guess peta doesn't count humans as cruelty free.",586472,1617683235,2021-04-06 12:27:15,1379891,18,1

Not only my own cultures are full of vegan recipes (creole, soul food, Indian, African, French are my cultures... I'm mixed), but the more I travel and meet new people the more I wanna slap and kick myself many years ago before I decided to really give up meat/dairy.

I have some friends from Asia and they introduced me to a lot of their plant based food, but recently another friend from South Korea showed me some pages he follows and I LOST MY MIND.

It's mind fucking blowing that these few types of meats are the center of all recipes when there are thousands of ingredients out there to take your food to the next level.

Honestly if everyone knew about plant based food around the world they wouldn't even touch meat anymore.

Even if I didn't care about the animals, the environment and I still consumed meat I would be lying and delusional to think that meat is just better/too good to give up.

vegan,mkvgm3,JBen_V,"Canadians: Here is an easy way to fight bill C-205, Canada's federal Ag-Gag law","Cross posted in r/VeganActivism

As  you may know, Bill C-205, Canada's federal ag-gag law, has passed  second reading in the house of commons with the support of the Conservatives and the NDP. On its face, Bill C-205 looks like an   attempt to prevent disease on farms, but don't be fooled—this dangerous  bill targets animal advocates who go on farms without permission, but  lets farmers off the hook for creating disease risks. Steep penalties include massive fines and even jail time for animal advocates. This is a  tactic that conservatives use worldwide- make already illegal things  illegal-er, with a view to demonizing animal rights advocates, and  punishing and deterring animal rights activism.

However, it hasn't passed third reading yet, so it isn't law. There's still time to stop this nonsense.

Here's  how you can help if you are a Canadian: Animal Justice has made an  online tool that makes it easy to send an e-mail to your MP. Check it  out here: [https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78832/action/1](https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78832/action/1)

While  it is important to let your MP know that you don't want this bill  passed, this is particularly important if you live in an NDP riding.

Are you a Canadian currently living abroad? No problem - Animal Justice has made a convenient form for you too: [https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78992/action/1](https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78992/action/1)

Are  you not Canadian, but are a big fan of both animal rights and Canada?  If you live in a place with ties to Canada, and a local left/centre left  party, or even a centrist or right wing party that is somewhat  pro-animal that has ties to Canada, please email your MP/Member of  Congress/Representative/Senator and tell them that they should let it be  known to their Canadian friends that this kind of nonsense isn't acceptable.",586323,1617658288,2021-04-06 05:31:28,1404838,0,1

I'd ideally like to be fully vegan by my 28th birthday in July, but I have some things that I foresee as being difficult for my personal transition, so I'm hoping to get some tips and tricks!

&amp;#x200B;

* We currently do our grocery shopping through Instacart, and I'm worried about not being able to see actual labels without looking it up on the manufacturer's website if it's not on the Instacart website. The extra work of seeking out the label isn't a big deal, but I'm worried that the label I find online will be different from what is on the actual product, if that makes sense?
* Eating out at restaurants that aren't fully vegan. Thankfully I have two AMAZING fully vegan restaurants close to my home, and a ton of places with vegan options. But I'm foreseeing situations like I was in Saturday: out shopping with a friend and we made a split decision on lunch. It was a local mexican restaurant, and I got veggie fajitas without sour cream. But I worry about the ingredients in like the tortillas and the refried beans. How do y'all handle this?
* My in-laws are pretty awful and don't make it a point to accomodate me when we visit, but I have no problem bringing my own veggie burgers or whatever and eating sides that everyone else is having. But that will change a bit when I'm vegan vs. lacto-ovo veg. Anyone have similar issues? Do you just bring your own food because that's how I'm leaning.",586292,1617653849,2021-04-06 04:17:29,1409277,6,1

I came to the US from Bangladesh as an international student. I am currently in my senior year and would be graduating in about a month. My university is in small town in the South where, being a predominantly conservative state, my only viable options to shop for grocery are Walmart and Kroger. There are no vegan restaurants around me either. I live with 3 roommates who are all meat eaters, and we often buy common food items together (like buying a 20 lbs bag of rice and sharing it between us). Also, although this may go without saying, I'm hella broke. 

Now, I have recently watched a couple documentaries on the ethical, health and environmental aspect of animal agriculture, and I am completely convinced that I want to go vegan. I am not overly health conscious. However, I think I would like to make nutritional completeness a goal in my transition to veganism. The purpose of this post is to get some help from any of you, if possible, with some roadblocks: 

1. I have a taste preference for my traditional foods. Think Indian veg food with the addition of small portions of fish (which is mostly added for flavor as well as protein) and other non-veg Indian items like chicken Tikka masala and such. I'm considering replacing the fish in the traditional vegetable dishes with some other kind of protein that's relatively cheap (maybe adds some flavor too?). What would be some of my options? 
2. I watched some videos suggesting that I buy legumes, nuts, beans and whole grain from whole food stores where I can get the exact amount I need. Having no whole food stores near me, what would be my option to include these ingredients in my food? 
3. What are some good vegan snacks that would be comparable to hot Cheetos, or Lay's kettle-cooked jalapeno chips? Are there any popular brand name chips that are vegan? 
4. Please also include any tips, if you have any, to save money on grocery trips.

For me, I haven't gotten the virus but I did get my gallbladder taken out; and since then, it's been hard to eat anything unhealthy; everytime I eat cheese, milk, more than a dash of oil or butter, etc. I feel pain or very uncomfortable. I decided to eat plant based/vegan (though I'm not putting a label on it yet) and reinvent foods I used to be able to eat, and find healthy alternatives as well as just eating fruits and vegetables and stuff. It's literally the only way I've been able to eat. And for some reason once I started eating a lot more vegan/whole foods, real meat has just...been unappealing to me. Though from my memory it hasn't caused pain. 

Now, I've done this before, just not at this scale. Before when I went whole plant based, I would literally just eat vegetables and fruit, just in...bowls. Stir fry. That's it, that was as far as the cooking or creativity went, which made it very boring. Back then I was also anemic so after a while I also got fatigued. But my red blood cell count has risen thanks to transition, and thanks to vegans on youtube I have been able to be SO creative with plants it's insane!

Back to the title...Do you think the events of the pandemic--as tragic as it is--is in a spiritual sense ""forcing"" (in a good sense of the word? lol) people to go plant based/vegan to treat themselves and the animals and world better to get in another stage of life?

I visited now again for Easter and brought a vegan quiche for dinner but she decided to also serve a giant dish with heaps of salmon, and also lamb. Fucking lamb on Easter, how horrible can you be.. After dinner I cried my eyes out and I really don't know what to do, even after almost 5 years I still have to bring my own food because they will simply not make anything I can eat.

vegan,mki5lg,blablabrah,"A ""pick-me vegan""","Yes, I am using a feminist term of a ""pick-me girl"" who seeks an approval of men to describe a category of vegans who seek approval of omnivores.
""She/he/they is not like other vegans, they are not annoying"" is what pick-me vegans strive for which personally makes me confused. 
Who are you a vegan for? Other people or animals? I bet if animals could understand that, they would not mind you constantly talking about the abuse they have endure on a daily basis.
The only reason why an omni would say ""she's not like most vegans, she's not annoying af"" about you is if you DON'T TALK ABOUT VEGANISM. 
Which sort of defeats the purpose of ethical veganism. 
As long as you don't point out contradictory morality of omnivores' actions making them feel uncomfy as a result, you are a cool vegan. 
I can see how some omnivores and ""cool"" vegans can say an argument like ""cool vegans are the ones who don't force their lifestyle onto others"" which is bullshit that some vegans believe.

If you see a person kicking a dog on the street and you call them out for that, would that be forcing your non-kicking-dogs lifestyle onto them? Even if so, good. 
Supporting animal abuse is a shitty lifestyle and they should be judged for that.

Personal freedom should exist up until a person's actions start hurting others. 
So I will judge until they get it, I won't shut up about veganism and If you care about animals then you should too. 
Otherwise, if we adapt our behaviour to omnis' liking then we wouldn't be doing our job of fighting against animal abuse. Then what's the point of you being vegan?",586068,1617621053,2021-04-05 19:10:53,1442073,43,1

vegan,mkej2e,skwee357,Rapid weight loose after switching to PB diet.,"Hey!

In March I've decided to do 30 days of Plant Based diet. I cut out almost all meat and dairy products and embarked on a journey of tasty and colorful food. I'm continuing to stick to my diet as of today as I find benefits in PB diet.

Together with my journey, I've monitored my weight. On February 28th I was weighted 66.8kg, today me weight is 63.6kg. I've lost more than 3kg in a month+ and I'm starting to worry.

I wasn't a heavy meat eater before that and I rarely ate dairy products. On the other hand, before March, I can't remember when was the last time I've ate beans or peas. I tried to do calorie counting for some time and I'm not under eating. I can reach 2200+ calories a day and I rarely feel hungry, so I don't think that I'm under nourished.

However, this sudden weight drop bothers me from health perspective. I **suspect** it might be related to the fact that I did sort of drastic diet change and it takes the body some time to adjust, but I'm wondering if someone else experienced similar symptoms.

vegan,mkde3h,lemalduporc,"Today I had one of the best days of my life, I just want to share.","This will be long, I'm sorry for that, but I'm emotional right now haha. Thank you for your time.

I've been vegan for 6 years. I had always said the food is the easiest part, what's challenging of being vegan is other people. I've been mocked, insulted and judged, people had called me names, even friends and family. And mind you, I've never been agressive or ""pushy"" or anything, I believe ""forcing"" people doesn't work because people have to make the connection themselves in order to have a permanent and genuine change, but I speak about my convictions if asked. People always feel attacked so for a time I just smiled and keep my thoughts for myself (not anymore, but that's another topic).

Anyways. I've had a couple of boyfriends through that time. One was abusive and used to mock me, and the other one tried to ""comply"" with the ""issue"" and it felt it (I) was an inconvinience (we sometimes went to vegan restaurants but he still ate animals when we were together, he also said he could be vegan for me in the future if we lived together, but that didn't sit right with me because I didn't want to be the reason).

Anyways, I began a new relationship on May last year. He is amazing, honestly I didn't think I could be this happy. Guys, I found the one. He's the most intelligent, the sweetest, the kindest, the funniest, the sexiest. He isn't vegan, but he respects I am and from day one, he has cooked and eaten plant based whenever we are together. I had an amazing birthday, Christmas and new years eve feast. We share recipes and experiment with food. It is great. 

For the first time in my life, I feel that I can truly be myself with someone. He listens, we often debate and try to see things from the other one's prespective. So I just share my thoughts whever I see something that angers me or frustrates me, I vent to him. And he is always there for me. 

This week he told me he started reading some things about animal rights, so I decided to give him my copy of DeGrazia's introduction to the topic (amazing book, it changed my life, I strongly recommend it). I didn't think much about it. Then today we had a picnic (with safe precautions) and I shared my thoughts on the videos of a vegan youtuber that had made me question my approach to veganism. I think I have to change the ""pick me vegan"" behaviors I sometimes have. Anyways, he listened and then he told me he hasn't consumed animals since last Tuesday. He told me he has always thought there was something wrong about  animal product-food and now that he isn't eating it, he feels a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. Although he thanked me for speaking about the topic, he isn't doing it for me, but for the right reasons, the animals. His journey has started and I feel the luckiest woman in this planet.

I always thought I couldn't be with someone in the long run if they weren't vegan. Anti-speciesism is as important for me as anti-racism or anti-sexism or anti-homophobia. Discrimination is all the same for me and being against it is a fundamental part of my identity, so I always wished for someone who shared my same values. And I found him. I'm just so happy.

I'm so proud of him, and if you happen to read this, I love you A.",585955,1617600060,2021-04-05 13:21:00,1463066,15,1

vegan,mkbf0w,chellemedus,How do I get enough nutrients when only eating 1200-1400 calories a day?,"I have been slightly overweight for probably 6-7 years and I started counting calories and realised I was eating like 1800-2500 calories a day (as a 5'7 woman). I'm currently living a sedentary lifestyle so have been eating 1400 calories max the past 2 weeks and have already lost 4-5lbs! 

About 8 months ago I was getting dizzy so I started taking a multi-vitamin and have been fine since then. I tried to stop taking the multi-vitamin once and the dizziness came back so that further confirmed that I was lacking something even when I was eating a lot of calories. However, since I've been eating 1400 calories I am still taking my multi-vitamin, but now my dizziness is back. It specifically happens whenever I stand up. 

I'm using myfitnesspal and I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate, but according to it I seem to not be getting enough of several nutrients, particularly protein and iron. Seems as though I get around 25-40g of protein a day. I'm not really sure what to do as I feel like my diet is pretty healthy, so I don't know how to add more nutrients without adding more calories.

To give insight into how I usually eat:

Breakfast - fruit and nut bar

Lunch - usually some variation of a salad. Ingredients I use often include avocado, falafel, chickpeas, beans, spinach, cucumber, etc. Sometimes I'll have a lentil and vegetable soup with bread instead.

Dinner - sometimes i'll have a bean and mince  chilli with avocado, sometimes cheesy pasta with spinach, sometimes tofu and chickpea curry, sometimes a lentil cottage pie w/ veg, etc.

Snacks - I usually have 1-2 snacks a day including stuff like choc rice cakes, quinoa chips, pretzels w/ peanut butter, popcorn, yoghurt, etc.

When I look up what vegan foods are high in protein or high in iron I see all the foods that I eat every day/week so I don't understand what to do. I eat 1400 calories as this is what is recommended to me, but could this recommendation only be good if it's a omni diet? Am I meant to eat more calories as a vegan? Will I still be able to lose weight if so?

Btw - I've been vegan for 4 years and I've never noticed being consistently dizzy/tired until about a year ago before I started taking the multi-vitamin.",585928,1617592409,2021-04-05 11:13:29,1470717,6,2

vegan,mk6s4g,peanutsandfuck,"People have such a twisted view of what's ""objective"" and what's a ""belief"" or ""opinion""","I honestly don't understand how people can even be okay with killing animals because they like it, never mind laughing at others for *not* doing that, all while they cry over someone so much as yelling at a dog.

Anyway, I'm not allowed to talk about it with my family because they'll say, ""You can't bring up dogs, it's not the same thing! You have your opinions and we have ours."" So while they're sitting eating lamb or veal and I just don't say a word, they still don't know why I'm upset? Then they'll keep asking, ""What's bothering you? I know you! I know you're upset about something!!!"" What do you want me to answer?

If I say, ""I'm upset because of the animal abuse,"" they'll say that's just an opinion. ""You can't let yourself get upset about that, you always ruin our fun, we're just trying to celebrate and have a good time!"" I'm not allowed to be sad that you celebrate life and special occasions by killing babies? 

They've many times told me I'm not allowed to talk about it and they get mad when I do, and their answer is always the same: ""That's just your opinion! Opinions are subjective, you can't tell us how to live our lives. Live and let live. I respect your choice to be vegan, you should respect our choice not to!""

And yet, the other day I decided (in the privacy of my own home while eating in front of the couch) to lick my plate. My sister looked at me and said ""That's disgusting!"" 

So to maybe give her an idea, I said ""Well that's just your opinion! You can't tell me how to live my life. I respect your choice not to lick plates, respect my choice to do it!"" She could not believe what she heard, like I was some kind of crazy person, and said to me, **""Well SOME things are OBJECTIVELY wrong!""** 

Hmm, so violently killing a baby animal is just a subjective opinion that doesn't concern anyone but you and me, but which utensil I decide to touch with my mouth based on arbitrary social mores is ""objective""? 

It bugs me because they always tell me what to do, and say something is ""rude,"" and constantly judge everything I do. But when I even get upset and don't say a word because of systematic mass slaughter, I'm out of line and no one should ever judge. Every single thing they think is worthy of judging people for seems like *nothing* compared to the seriousness of what the meat industry is doing to the world, and yet they *laugh* making fun of vegans in mocking voices going ""mEaT iS mUrDeR HAHAHAHAHAHAHA BUNCH OF CRAZIES 😂""

Another thing that happened is when I go grocery shopping to buy vegan stuff and my mom asks me to pick up some meat or dairy. I've told her many times why I'm not comfortable doing that, and even asked her what she would do if someone asked her to go kill a dog for her, saying ""You don't have to *eat* it, it's not for *you*, don't be selfish!"" And yet nope, she still thinks I'm selfish for ""literally forcing"" my views on her. Last time I said no, she says to me, **""I understand you have your opinions and you're very passionate, but sometimes you have to put your beliefs aside and do the right thing!""**

""The right thing"" is killing baby animals, and my ""belief"" is that I don't personally like it? She doesn't realize I could say the exact same thing to her, right? Put *your* beliefs (that 5 minutes of enjoyment on your tastebuds is a good reason to kill a baby animal) aside, and do the right thing (leave them alone).

Sometimes I want to give up hope and feel useless.

TL;DR Everything a meat-eater believes is considered ""objective"" or ""neutral,"" and all the facts we try to express are just ""beliefs,"" ""opinions,"" or even ""just like religion.""",585850,1617576344,2021-04-05 06:45:44,1486782,7,4
vegan,mk6b08,Far_Pomelo,People trying to make me eat non-vegan food,"I turned fully vegan 3 weeks ago because i recognised my moral inconsistencies regrading non-human animals. I am very happy with my decision plus i haven’t found it challenging at all. My parents have been  really supportive overall but sometimes they try to make me eat non vegan food. I’ve tried to explain the ethics behind my decision and also made them watch several documentaries with me, however they still try to make me eat non vegan food. My mum tried to make me feel guilty for making her feel guilty for contributing to the exploitation of animals.
My mum said that she will make a lot of non-vegan food so I will be forced to eat it so the food doesn’t go to waste. 
Also today my aunt offered me a beef burger (I have told her many times that I’m vegan) because she thought I would value my taste buds more than the suffering of the animals. 

Is there a better way to respond to things like this as nothing seems to be working?",585845,1617574807,2021-04-05 06:20:07,1488319,21,4
vegan,mk67xn,heckyouyourself,How do you deal with people who know exactly what goes on and just don’t care?,"I’ve told both my parents about what goes on in animal agriculture, and though my mom agreed to watch dominion at some point, both say they’d never give up meat. I’m fine with that, I don’t care what they eat, I just wanna know how to cope with knowing that people I love and respect are informed enough to realize what goes on and simply don’t care.

My mom insists that she can’t live without meat, and that our local, organic farm is different from the big ones. She’s a bit more in denial IMO, and she just gets real quiet when I bring up the horrors.

My dad, on the other hand, isn’t in any denial, he just doesn’t care. I’ve told him what goes on, (not in an annoying way, I wanted him to understand why I was upset, not for him to stop eating meat), so it’s fair to assume he knows, he just doesn’t care. His reason for not caring is that “there’s no way to ethically feed billions of people” and “you don’t wanna know how the sausage gets made”.

I respect my dad so much and I know he’s a good person, but it bothers me that he doesn’t care. Also, he has kind of a history of viewing animals as objects, in a way. He has a fish tank and referred to cheaper fish as being “expendable”, meaning he doesn’t care if they die.

I believe in the good in people and that most people don’t care because they don’t know. But my dad knows and doesn’t care. And it upsets me. Again, I’m not trying to meddle in their lifestyle, I just don’t understand why they’re like this. 

And they care so much about our pet dog. Once I pulled her by the collar and they both told me off. Which is good of them. I just don’t understand why that compassion doesn’t extend to other animals. It makes no sense to me. Does it make sense to any of you? If so, how? I’d really love to understand.",585845,1617574531,2021-04-05 06:15:31,1488595,4,4

A lot of answers I have found on Google or with minimal research. It hasn’t been easy but I’m definitely committed to doing this.

In any case, my question is about sodas.
When I started, I had read that white sugar has bone char, making it an animal product. I wasn’t really much of a soda drinker but to satisfy that crave, I would have the Coke bottles imported from Mexico since it’s made from sugar cane.

As I’ve visited vegan restaurants, they often have fountain drinks with coke products. Are fountain drink sodas vegan? Am I looking at normal soda wrong thinking it has bone char?

Honestly, I'm trying to put together a lifestyle that is more centered around self care, and I haven't been putting enough effort into the food that I eat.

Why is it that the total use of animal products is inhumane, and not just the consumption of meat? Isn't the use of animal products derived from non-lethal uses just a result of a symbiotic relationship between man and animal? Is it possible for humans to have relationships with animals that isn't destructive and exploitative?

Human beings sell and provide human made products like blood, breastmilk, DNA, etc. Is that inhumane to do? Or is that different than the use of animal products? If so, how?

On top of that, I’m starting to live a very active life, where before I was mainly sedentary.

All of this has made is difficult for me to be vegan right now. Do NOT get me wrong, I DO NOT want to go back to animal products, and it breaks my heart I’m having this struggle at all, but I’m just super lost as to what to do.

I’m trying to get all my vitamins and minerals in so I can be fully nourished, as well as get enough protein and fats for the active lifestyle I have now, but with my limited food choices from being picky &amp; low-inflammation foods it’s SO difficult!

Do you guys mind sharing what your meal plans/supplements look like on a daily basis? And if you’re a picky eater, what helped you or what foods/recipes are “safe” to you? Also if you happen to eat low-inflammation, what are some recipes you guys like?

vegan,mk21k2,Lenkstudent,Is 20ish years the turning point?,"As with most everyone else, my biggest regret about going vegan is not doing it sooner. I'm approaching my two year anniversary soon and it's at least a start to help with my conscience about my diet prior to making the switch.

Two years ago today I still ate dairy. I was still complicit in the torture and exploitation of poor dairy cows. Some if not many of those cows are probably still alive today and continue to suffer, so I still feel complicit in what is happening to them because while I no longer fund what is happening to them *now*, I was responsible for the demand that ultimately lead to them being bred into existence in the first place.

Only after 5-6 years after going vegan will no dairy cow suffer due to my past choices. Because they've been murdered. But I feel it's actually somewhere around 20 years, or the life expectancy of a cow, when the debt can even begin to be repaid. I paid for a life born into slavery and I paid for a premature death.

I feed my cats this so they survive but why should their lives be more important than the immense torment these 52 chickens experience per year?  I love my cats but I can't help but feel like having human companions that are carnivorous perpetuate the very atrocities we need to come together to stomp out.

Man, it's been a journey.  I gave up meat (and always had to specify that it included poultry and fish) in 2007.  I went vegan in April of 2013, and haven't looked back.  This month marks eight years of veganism.  In the last eight years, veganism has come a long way.  I went from having a couple of insta-foods that I could buy at the local chain grocer to having an exponentially growing number of items that I seem to be able to have.  The irony, of course, is that I eat a lot healthier these days and don't buy most of the new products that are on the market on any sort of regular basis.  I do my best to try a fair few of them, though, just to see what they're like.

Just setting an example for people has gotten people thinking, and my partner completely made the transition to veganism last summer.  This movement seems to only be beginning.

**I dedicate this post to all of the vegans who were doing it before I was, paving the way to make it a hell of a lot easier for me and everyone else these days.**

vegan,mk0ow0,Waste-Comedian4998,Need to vent about in-law teasing me,"The other day in the family group chat with my in-laws, my SIL - in the context of another conversation - slipped in a dig at me for being vegan. When I politely called her out on it and laid down a boundary saying that it's not okay to make me the butt of jokes about my lifestyle, she gave a totally transparent BS apology saying that she ""respected"" my choices and that it was just a ""lighthearted tease"".

Let me be clear that I do not talk about my veganism unless someone else brings it up, and I have never suggested to her that I disapprove of her choice to eat meat. Literally have never, ever gone there with her. 5 years I've known her, 1 1/2 of them as a vegan.

I followed up with her privately saying that I appreciated the apology, but that there was no valid reason to tease me for not eating animals. That respect and teasing aren't compatible in my view. That as a lifelong vegetarian I've been the butt of thousands of similar jokes and that they were the source of some childhood trauma and abusive behavior by people I thought were my friends. That her words really hurt me and were confusing in the context of an otherwise positive and supportive relationship. I sent her [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/vegan-food.html). I told her that I hoped she could empathize and hoped that this additional context could strengthen our relationship. 

As a progressive gay feminist of color, I thought she'd be able to empathize. All I got back?

&gt; i hear you

I'm honestly gobsmacked. I didn't exactly expect ""love and light"", but that curt, empty, icy 3-word reply was not on my possibility list. The fact that it came from a grown-ass woman in her late 30s. The difference between how she handled the convo in private vs in front of her family. The total disregard of me basically pouring my heart out to her. It hurts. It confirms my previous suspicions about her being vapid and self-centered at her core.

But I know that her reaction isn't about me, and I know that this interaction is really a blessing because she showed me her true colors, both who she is and how she really sees me (and by extension my husband, her brother).

Obviously there is the superiority of those who do it for moral reasons and respect to them. Definitely more swayed by it lately personally but it didn’t convince me initially so I wouldn’t call myself an ethical vegan. 

So many great reasons, so much data and philosophy. There is however one group I looks down on abs honestly I dislike more and more the longer I’m vegan. “Icky” vegans. 

Oh you think meat is icky? 

It all started when you tried to cook a stake and the tissue at the bottom of the packet was dripping in blood? Hahaha yeah so funny how you only ate stake at restaurants because of that before giving it up all together.

Really liked drum sticks until you bit a blood vessel and you can’t look at chicken nuggets the same way? 

Did you know that sausage are sometimes made using pig intestines? Ewwwwww so gross that when an animal is eaten all of it at least gets fucking used rather than thrown away to rot for its suffering. Hahahah yeah right gross. 

You used to eat cheese all the time, yum how could you live without it right, none of that stinky stuff though hahaha gross mould am I right? Then one day you left you’re really expensive cheddar at the back of the fridge and part of it froze and the other part went all fuzzy after you got back from holiday. Hahah yeah it’s a lot of money to loose, can’t look at any cheese the same way anymore though right? Mould hahaha gross yeah. 

You just don’t like dairy and think it’s gross now that you know puss gets in it? That a stupid reason, it was just as puss filled when you last had it. 

You just think that killing an animal is icky, no problem with the death of its desire to live, it’s poor living conditions, is being a product, no no no just that killing is icky. 



You’re not a vegan your just upset knowing how you’re food gets made.",585747,1617553766,2021-04-05 00:29:26,1509360,12,0

I had stayed strong in my values and knew I would not be going back. After a few years he couldn’t believe I was still a vegan. After we hung out a few times he wondered how I was staying so strong, he actually tried some of my vegan foods I made and really liked it. He had been eating meat for his entire 40 years of being alive, he didn’t think it would be possible. 

Eventually he became curious himself. I turned 21 years old 3 months ago and that’s when he contacted me, explaining how he wish he was a vegan, he actually cared about the animals, and realized he can be completely healthy and even more healthy as a side effect of being vegan. That’s when I decided we should live together. We have been helping each other create a vegan life together ever since he moved into my apartment, we really haven’t looked back since. He learned how to cook and prepare vegan meals, and even started making me food. After he cut out dairy a lot of his back pain cleared up and his energy improved. We are so close now like brothers.",585727,1617550608,2021-04-04 23:36:48,1512518,11,3
vegan,mjy5k3,kappakingtut2,Can I get some opinions on protein sources? Some of the most common sources are problematic for me because of a medical thing,"I'm living with IBS and I still haven't figured out exactly which foods trigger my problems. I want to try the elimination diet again. But that would mean eliminating a lot of the stuff people use for protein.

No sieten because because of the gluten
No soy. So no tofu, or edamame
No nuts. So no almonds. 
No chickpeas. No beans of any kind. Lentils have always been particularly troublesome for me. 

So what's left?

I guess I can still eat sunflower seeds and quinoa? Maybe brown rice? But I think starchy foods like rice can cause bloating which is a problem for me.

A whole bunch of multigrain chips, chips made with flaxseed, quinoa, sesame seed. And I think it helped. I'm not sure if it was because of a protein-rich day.

vegan,mjtcuv,Linie99,How to deal with omni roommates?,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been vegan for two months now (vegetarian before that) and I'm encountering some problems with my omni roommates. For context: I am a university student living in a shared house with some other students. Despite our differences, we all get along well and we usually eat dinner together (we take turns cooking each day). Moving out is not an option on the short term (perhaps in a year or so, but definitely not sooner than that).

The main problem is that my roommates do not want to adjust their cooking to my dietary preferences; whereas vegetarian was not really a problem to them (I'd just get a meat substitute alongside my veggies), cooking vegan meals is something they find 'too complicated' because it requires more adjustments. I also do not feel comfortable asking them to take my relatively new dietary preferences into account, because they already mock me whenever they see me drinking non-dairy milk (""oAtS hAvE fEeLiNgS tOo"") and they constantly try to debate me, while obviously not taking my arguments seriously (which is a whole other problem on its own, really). As a consequence, I am still regularly consuming meals which do contain milk, cheese and other dairy products, something which I find increasingly uncomfortable...

Have any of you had similar experiences with omni roommates in the past? How did you cope with this? I'm really grateful for any advice I can get!",585644,1617530267,2021-04-04 17:57:47,1532859,27,1

Just take the best vegan cheese you can find Vio Life Mozarella blocks and Parmesan Powder works. Other good brands are Daiya and Green Vie.

Basics.

1. Grate it yourself
2. Add the Parmesan
3. Add small amounts of almond milk.
4. Heat on low and turn to sauce at desired level
5. Use as you want to

The way this works is melting vegan cheese evaporates the water and makes it taste bad so hydrating it helps prevent it worsening and improves texture flavour and use.

Best for melted added on top pasta pizza after cooked etc but even in sandwiches it’s better like this makes it taste real af",585605,1617521948,2021-04-04 15:39:08,1541178,2,1

I would never make the statement that male cattle in factory farms are living the high life in comparison to their female peers, but it took me all the way to now to recognize the sexual abuse committed against males in the name of making dairy products.

vegan,mjh0k7,The_Anticarnist,Thank you for acknowledging the horror that no one wants to,"Lamb used to be my absolutely favourite animal to eat. But I didn't see it that way.

I don't think I ever once imagined a lamb shank to be an actual leg of a baby. Not once. I think I tried while eating it in a restaurant at one point, but my mind just wouldn't let itself go there. As a piece of food it looks big, but I found it difficult to imagine a limb so small. I didn't let myself try to imagine it for long.

There's something mind numbing about the act of eating. I remember agonising over menus before I was vegan and I was beginning to learn more than I felt comfortable with about how animals were slaughtered so I could enjoy their meat. - But as soon as a decision was made and it was on a plate in front of me, all guilt would subside. I imagine I'm not the only one to experience this phenomena of instant cognitive dissonance at the dinner table.

For those brave enough to seek the truth and to face it head on, or even those who can't face it but realise they shouldn't be taking advantage of the horrors they can't bare to witness first hand - Thank you. Society has made it easy to ignore, so thank you for paying attention and not participating in carnism as far as possible and practicable. Our culture has been formed in a way that cruelty has become so common and acceptable that anyone who attempts to avoid supporting it is seen as irrational or strange.

vegan,mjf8fi,PoliticalNerdMa,Lying about veganism okay ?,"Okay. Is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it, noticing that all your “excuses” seemingly align with vegan outcomes?

In terms of health...I watched my father die of cancer. It broke me. Every time I see the animal products he consumed a lot of....I think of the agony he went through in the last stages of his life....and I can’t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again...so I immediately go for whole food plants to hopefully prevent it.

A lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line. While I disagree with them, I’m not a doctor so I don’t know how educated I am on the topic, so I stay quiet.

My father got cancer. His father got cancer. Both died in their 50s long before they should have... both the kindness members of the family... sad face.

Everyone (in former associations I had with them, when we would regularly eat together... we don’t do it anymore because of ... reasons... see profile for irrelevant explanation of that...) heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic.

Thing is.... they eat so much god dam meat. Every meal: 
Meat: red meat; fish; chicken; or some other former sentient animals flesh.

So much bacon. Ungodly amounts of bacon. So much so, that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup (she’s the only one who I told I was plant based. But she’s not the brightest person and never understood it, so this wasn’t intentional on her part, trust me): she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it. Thinking it was fine since it was only a bit.

Dairy: cheese, so much god dam cheese; milk; 

When I was a young child I naturally consumed The same foods, up until about 15.

Looking back, my symptoms were INSANE and really bad, such that I’m surprised I never considered the food I was eating could be causing me to have these issues.

Rashes: EVERYWHERE. For arms. Shins. Oh my god dam fingers. Bottom of my feet. It was so bad. Even when I didn’t scratch it would get worse, and when I did scratch I’d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point. “It’s only that bad because you scratch. If you stopped it would go away. (Nah it’s not the food at all). I’d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up.)

Cravings: I’d go through non stop physical shakes if I didn’t  have dairy products 3 times a week. My loving father had to limit My ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because I was ballooning up. But i was always trying... my best.. I swear... but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until I gave in.

Depression and fatigue. NON STOP FATIGUE. I’d be told by family that I just wasn’t eating enough, them proudly patting their ballooned stomach. I forced myself to eat more of the garbage food. I definitely ate more, but my fatigue got worse and I gained weight 


All of this is to just show.. how sick and tired I was of my health feeling like garbage. So I stoped. I told family My decision to just limit (l said lying, knowing i wasn’t eating any behind closed doors) animal products. So please , if they cook, just give me the non animal based parts of the meal.  I’d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho, they had to do NOTHING extra.

First: they asked why. I explained that I was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms. They told me I was being silly, it wasn’t the food. And that I needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods, it’s in our DNA!

Second: when the above strategy did not work, and it became clear that for about 2 months I had not gave up (skin improving before their eyes. But they ignored that, claiming I was just not scratching... I was still scratching a lot. They didn’t believe me). They tried a new strategy: guilt tripping me.

They told me I could 100% “cheat” 1 day a week and my health would be fine. When I told them “cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure, and I don’t get pleasure from the side effects I do still get after eating it, so I don’t “cheat” with foods that cause pain... they god mad.

“Oh. So your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it? Wow.”

“No. I do eat the food she makes. See, I’m right now eating plain pasta. L

“It’s rude to not eat everything. You are insinuating she’s doing a bad job and making you sick. That’s rude”

“What? No, I’m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work. And if I add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative. “

“I disagree. It’s rude. “

“(Seeing no other way out, I lied) my doctor told me to do this. Are you telling me I should ignore my doctor? “

This shut down all complaints. Once I tied it into “my doctor told me to do this”, they had a difficult time arguing back that I’m being rude. Although they did try, and the sane people at the table would go 

“dude. Does OP tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended? “

“That’s not the same thing. This is food not medication.”

“I specifically heard you tell me your doctor told YOU not to eat X food groups and you wouldn’t need to take the anti acid pills. So unless you want us to judge YOU for ignoring doctors orders, leave op alone” (GO. GRANDMA. LOVE YOU. SO MUCH... even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad. But you stopped when I asked you not to, so we gucchi).

So....I know that was a long rant. But. My point: when I lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family, or awful people in general... it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life. I don’t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up. But, is lying unethical, and contributing to the problem even more, and I should be willing to take the hostility ?

When my family suspected I’d become vegan, the anger was INSANE. They literally told me I was lying to do them for X, Y, and Z reasons. They went off on how I was judging them for their choices and I needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food. And until I finally lied, telling them it was my doctors advice.... they kept getting worse.

Now. I am away from those family members now. But.... I just dont think I can handle the hostility associated with activism. But I can not contribute to the problem. Is this okay?",585414,1617477560,2021-04-04 03:19:20,1585566,11,1

vegan,mjcy94,CapitalSkirt,IRON SUPPLEMENTS! 💊 💊,"Hey all, 

My question is for folks who actively supplement with iron. I’ve been vegan for about 7 years and mainly vegetarian for many years before that. Recently, after experiencing a myriad of symptoms, I discovered I had low ferritin (26), where anything under 30 is an absolute iron deficiency. 

Admittedly I wasn’t consuming as many green vegetables nor beans, but I was always eating sufficient amounts of tofu. 

So! For those of you who are aware of your iron levels and are consciously trying to raise them or simply maintain them; what supplement do you take? 

I’ve been taking Spatone but it’s a measly 5mg so that likely won’t help me much. Thus I’m in the market for a vegan friendly iron that won’t overload me but be something I can take consistently and sustainably.

I went vegan about a year ago after learning about some of the cruelty in the animal ag industries, but yesterday I watched Land of Hope and Glory and it was gut wrenching.  The abuse these animals are subject to is so so much worse than I imagined.  It made me want to do something beyond just not buying the animals myself.  I know debating random people is limited in its effectiveness no matter how right you are, but if I could just make people see what I saw yesterday, I know some number of them will realize the truth and stop buying these products.  Which is why I'm thinking about setting up a VR booth and asking people to watch immersive footage.

vegan,mjb575,bathtubstyle,My brother gave us an ultimatum,"I need some advice on how to talk to him about it.
So, my brother (19) went vegan last year and it has been a topic of discussion at every family dinner ever since. No one has a problem with him being a vegan, my family even accommodates his diet.  I also went plant based for the most part and I totally get where he is coming from. 
The problem is, that his behaviour strains his relationship with our family and others. He always asks me ""when will you go fully vegan?"" and any effort shown is not enough for him. If there's a vegan option for him, it's not enough, cause the whole table should be vegan. 
A couple of weeks ago, my parents went to visit him in his flat. They brought homemade pizza and when he realised, that some pieces my parents ate had cheese on them (the plantbased cheese had run out), he kicked them out. ""There will be no slavery under my roof"". 

Now, our Easter brunch is supposed to be tomorrow. He told us he won't be attending, as long as there is a single animal product on the table. And it's not like there will be a Suckling pig or anything, it's just about a couple of eggs and some mayonnaise. 

How can I go on about this? Is there something I can tell him to convince him to come tomorrow? I don't want to spend Easter alone with my parents, it would be the first year without him. Any advice will be appreciated.",585345,1617465133,2021-04-03 23:52:13,1597993,28,1

I've been vegan just over a year and went to the dentist yesterday. First thing they asked me was are you a smoker (no)then do you drink red wine (said no, truth is of course yes but only seldom, and basically never this past year) do you drink tea, coffee (no, no)

What they were getting at of course is that my teeth were yellowish or perhaps a bit yellower than is usual (this makes it sound like they were in an awful state which I don't believe, but I guess dentists have different standards to us lay people). They booked me in to have my teeth properly cleaned by the dentist next week.

Found it a bit perplexing, thought it must just have been that it had been a while since I had had that kind of ""dentist cleaning"" done. I brush and floss religiously but perhaps you can never quite keep on top of it...

Brushing my teeth last night though I remembered every day I put Turmeric powder in my porridge, and it sure stains the whole bowl of porridge. I reckon that's it, and I'm gonna look up pills or capsules so I can have all the health benefits of Turmeric without making teeth yellow.

so i’ve been vegetarian for about 7 years then vegan since about august last year, and my sister turned straight to vegan in about november/ december. the rest of my family are meat eaters which obviously i don’t agree with so it was really nice having another vegan in the family, so whenever the topic would come up and i would speak about how the meat/ animal product industry is literally killing the planet (as well as it being unhealthy for your body) i’d have someone to completely back me up so i didn’t sound like a preachy dick while the rest of my family rolled their eyes, it was great. The problem now is that she’s saying that she doesn’t really have any interest in being vegan anymore and that when the UK lockdown is over in a couple months she’s almost definitely going to go vegetarian because when she’s out and about with friends and stuff her options are way too limited and she probably wouldn’t be able to find food, and idk i think it’s kind of bullshit. it seems like such a tiny problem that could be really easily solved by either making your own food and bringing it out (a bit of a hassle i know) or just going with something you don’t want to eat as much as a non-vegan option but you’ll make do because it’s still good food.it’s also that she says she PROBABLY won’t be able to find food, she doesn’t even know for sure... i feel like i shouldn’t be so personally upset by this, especially because i don’t feel this annoyed about my family eating meat? but if feels like a real bummer and almost a betrayal?? cause she seemed so passionate about the ethics and wellbeing of animals being very anti-cruelty and pro-not-killing-the-environment and now she’s like “ah fuck it life is easier for little old me when i don’t always have to only eat plant based” and it feels like she thinks her convenience is more important that the literal lives of animals and that it seems to go back on the values she’s seemed to have since turning vegan :( i’m probably overreacting i’m just really worked up about it especially because i don’t want to bring it up with her for fear of sounding like a proper asshole/ like i’m controlling her so i’m just bottling it up i guess?? 

tl;dr My sister has been vegan since november and says that when UK lockdown is over in june she’s almost definitely going to turn vegetarian because it’ll PROBABLY be too difficult to find vegan food when she’s out with friends or something. i’m upset about this for obvious reasons and idk if i should i bring it up with her or just let it go🤷‍♂️",585248,1617436991,2021-04-03 16:03:11,1626135,3,1

vegan,mj338t,toaaad7567,question from a omni,"hi, dumb omni here. my girlfriend told me she was a bit conflicted over our relationship a couple months ago, over me not being vegan and how often i eat meat, and i told her i'd try a vegetarian diet out. flash forward a month, and the only food in the house is meat related products, and i get really bad cravings and whenever i feel anxious i stress eat, it's a really bad habit that i've tried breaking before but i just, can't. i ended up making mac n cheese with bits of ham in it, and ever since that, it happened again and again and again. 


i just can't permanently do a vegetarian diet (i also have a shellfish allergy, and really hate cooked fish- i've considered going pescetarian but for those reasons i already don't eat fish), especially because vegetarian food is so scarce in my familys house. i'm honestly terrified she'll yell at me or breakup with me over this.  basically, my question is, how would you react if your partner was secretly an omni?",585231,1617431756,2021-04-03 14:35:56,1631370,17,1

vegan,mizgpi,Godsarefakezz,My super easy regular vegan meals,"Here are some of my quick, no stress, no way to screw up vegan recipes. 

Baked ziti: boil some pasta noodles. In a bowl, take some tofu and mash it up. Add some nutritional yeast, some salt, oregano or and basil. When the pasta is ready, place it in a over safe dish, put marinara sauce on top and then put the tofu on top of that. Put tin foil and place in oven. 

French bread pizza: do the same thing with the tofu. Cut the baguette in half, put pizza sauce or marinara sauce on first, then the tofu. Add your favorite toppings

Chickpea tacos: dice some onion and or cucumber. Take the chickpeas and mash them together with the onion and or cucumber. Add chili seasoning, and any other Mexican type seasoning you like. Place in the over just to toast it. I like to toast my tacos a little too! Add some lime!

Chickpea (tuna fish) sandwich: in place of tuna, I use chickpeas. I like to toast, so same as above but once the chickpeas and onions are toasted, mix it with vegan Mayo in a bowl. Then make your sandwiches

Pesto: spinach, basil, nutritional yeast, walnuts -
Blend and can be used as a dip or on any type of pasta noodles. Add tofu too!

Black beans or pinto beans on rice, sometimes I put it on brown rice or quinoa. No explanation. Add potatoes!

Middle Eastern Bowl: chickpeas (or green lentils)  on couscous or rice or quinoa. Add humus and any veggies you like. I also add sweet potatoes or potatoes 

Peanut butter and banana sandwich: self explanatory. I put it on whole wheat toast 

Green lentils on quinoa or couscous: I boil some water, add some salt and then when it boils, I add the lentil, cover and turn down to low and let it sit for 30 minutes. So simple, one of my favs.

vegan,mixd18,LavaRoseKinnie,Considering going vegan...but I am neurodivergent,"*please do not be judgy, I am new and I want to learn and change

Hello, I am newish to the concept of veganism (been learning about it for only 3 years) and I have been considering going vegan for some time now. I overall agree with the sentiment that animal lives have intrinsic value and the fact that 8% of the population is vegan is enough to convince me to participate. I believe that if that number continues to grow, the animal agriculture industry will die out or become obscure and as a communist, all exploitation is bad, including towards animals.

While I don’t particularly like animals, I recognize that they are Living for beings who experience pain, love and deserve a life beyond being used for consumption.  

However, I have autism, and I am an extremely picky eater.

When I say picky, I am not just talking about textures, I haven’t eaten a piece of fruit since I was in elementary school and most vegetables make me gag. I also can barley stomach salads and you couldn’t even pay me to eat that kind of stuff. There are very few textures I Can actually tolerate and a lot of vegan recipes admittedly kind of look like dogshit. 

I would have no problem actually cutting out stuff like meat (I hate the taste of milk and yogurt so I don’t eat those, but I do eat a lot of cheese). But finding healthy substitutes to those things is the difficult part—especially since I live in an area that doesn’t really have many supermarkets, yet alone vegan options. 

Seafood would also be a big problem for me since it’s one of the only proteins/sources of B-12 I get and I am going to be honest, I really like seafood. I also really love cheese and seafood and cheese are stuff that even from some vegans, say that the vegan replacements don’t taste good. 

One saving factor would be the fact I am obsessed with mushrooms and I could easily cut out all meat and replace it with mushrooms, but mushrooms alone doesn’t make up a balanced diet. 

This has just been circling my mind a lot and I don’t know if anyone is going to notice this, but yeah.",585127,1617409149,2021-04-03 08:19:09,1653977,33,1
vegan,miwoph,danasiamitchell,Diet Advice,"Hello. I'm a 16(F) and I'm very concerned about my health at the moment. I went vegan about a year ago (only for the animals), and ever since then, my food choices have just plummeted. That's not to say a non-vegan diet is inherently good for you, but when I wasn't vegan, I was given much more support, and thus, much more options. My family does support me somewhat (they are not vegan), and they buy me things like tofu, vegan snacks, and even got me a whole bunch of vegan stuff for my b-day. However, because they're not vegan (and because the world is generally non-vegan), I never really properly learned how to make anything that doesn't contain rotting corpses in it. I don't know how to cook a lot of vegan dishes, and I struggle to find recipes online that can cater to my living situation right now (my parents only buying vegan products they can afford). I also want to try and abstain from plant-based ""meats"" and other products like that; I want to cook real vegan meals, because I just think they taste better. My go-tos in the past have usually been things like white/brown rice with different veggies, depending on what we have. But in contrast, I eat a ton of processed junk throughout the day, like chips, soda, candy. And by the time dinner comes around, it's usually another gigantic load of sodium or processed, easy-to-make meals. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: I am 16, and I am concerned for my health, because I don't know how to follow a proper vegan diet, and all I eat is processed junk. Any advice would be appreciated.",585122,1617406906,2021-04-03 07:41:46,1656220,27,1

I care deeply for the environment, animals, and my body. I went vegetarian (which I know is not the same) about a year ago, but unfortunately had to go back to eating chicken (please don’t hate me, my mom and doctor both said I needed more protein) because I got very ill due to being malnourished. I wasn’t getting enough protein in my diet, despite eating lentils, beans, nuts, and other things. I even opted for some vegan patties, nuggets, pizza, and other things while being vegetarian. I absolutely HATED eating any thing with a beating heart. I still do. I feel guilty every time I eat chicken or any other meat. 

My mom supports me through everything, so if I told her I wanted to go vegan, she wouldn’t mind, I would just have to do intense research to make sure I don’t become malnourished again. The only issue is, my entire family eats meat... so whenever I have dieted, exercised, or even when I was vegetarian, I was the only one in my household. It was hard at first, but I just stopped craving meat and such. It is hard to do’s nothing remotely different when you’re in a house with people who don’t care about the meat industry and stuff. I guess they just aren’t as educated as I am. 

I really have a hard time finding foods I like. Or foods that are good. Or being full enough. I don’t want that to happen, because we all know that being hungry sucks.

vegan,mine9t,its_spoopy_time,My mother has finally discovered that keto is a lie.,"My mother has been convinced for a while now that keto is the diet that is going to make her lose weight. As a result, she's been talking down about my diet choices for literally months now, saying how crap it is that I eat so many grains because they are ""carby foods"". I've told her otherwise a couple of times, but it became clear that she was so convinced that she needed eggs and dairy and meat and that vegan diets were trash that I gave up for the sake of peace in my household. Besides, she doesn't reason well.

Well today, she went on weight watchers, and was stunned to realize that the majority of those really horrible grains and vegan foods that are demonized by her keto community are on her ""zero points"" list. It was genuinely shocking for her to realize that she's been sabotaging herself for months over misinformation and an unwillingness to learn.

And there's also that added enjoyment of her realizing that I wasn't the ignorant one. While it isn't that important, it does feel good after months of being told otherwise.",584953,1617379583,2021-04-03 00:06:23,1683543,32,1
vegan,milnjv,Walnut_MacGyver,I had an interesting thought about how to address the meat industry if one is vegan.,"I'd like to hear people's opinion on this, has it been talked about that, instead of getting people to stop eating meat (Ultimate goal) as the ""main"" goal.. That focus be shift to singling out the methods for which meat is harvested? No I don't mean in a ""-and this is why you shouldn't eat meat"" way, because that doesn't address the problem directly.
A person could go vegan today and still millions of animals will be killed tomorrow because everyone else isn't vegan. So what I mean is, attacking their methods directly.

Vegans could address their methods with the purpose of forcing a change to alternative methods that meet a supposed humane criteria. A method that is used to, theortically bring suffering and torture to zero if not the bare minimum. For starters its known that the methods they currently use are optimized for mass production, not for the regard of animals at all..
If these methods are approached with the sense of bettering the production instead of shutting it down (which is also the ultimate goal.) .. This will impact production value. As most ways to mass kill for demand won't meet the bare minimum of suffering criteria that has been set.

This should get support as most people don't support the suffering and torture of animals. So if a petition is started perhaps signatures would be bountiful if that reason is expressed for changes in regulation.

If it goes as expected, the prices of meat will rise due to new regulations of more attentive killings of animals. More attentive meaning more time consuming, less is being able to be produced.. The only option to compensate is hire more people, which eats away at the businesses money. The only way to compensate THAT is higher the prices. 
With prices going up, less people will buy or be able to buy, which would effectively put a dent in production value would it not?

This also ties into the forceful impregnation of animals. If you could prove in court that it is no different from the rape of a real animals by human hands (which is already illegal). You could forcibly change regulation to only have breedings done naturally. 
If the animals are being stressed out constantly and tortured, the last thing they are going to want to do is breed. That would indefinitely slow down production and make meat a rarity. Something not a lot of people could buy.

Anyway these realizations just happened to pop into my head and I wanted to share. Ultimately I think the approach is good in the long run.",584912,1617374231,2021-04-02 22:37:11,1688895,27,1

vegan,mil3of,nicktheturtle,How to deal with being dismissed with optics in mind?,"Preface: Having my feelings dismissed severely triggers me. I am new to veganism (made it my new year's resolution to be vegan by the end of the year, and I've made great peogress) but was a vegetarian for a lot of my teen years, whenever it was possible. My adoptive family, despite frequently using meat substitutes in their food, would ridicule me in public, with their friends, and at restauraunts for not wanting to eat meat. You probably have heard it, joking about forcing you to eat meat, tricking you, etc. I have dealt with previous mistreatment (hence why I was adopted) and basically just... Gave up until I ran off as an adult.

This, and the way veganism is so often openly mocked by others online, makes me really nervous to be in this situation if I ever mention my diet. I don't want to react poorly to someone and just be another person reinforcing the idea that veganism isnt something to take seriously. You're all probably much better equipped to handle these situations, please tell me what your strategies are. I want to be openly vegan someday once I'm actually 100% there. I want to be an advocate.

Last night I was laying in bed and couldn’t fall asleep for a while... I’m reading vegan news and saw about Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara helping with donating vegan meals to the LGBTQ+ community (shared last night if you’re interested!) and felt super moved. I just finally went fully vegan last month after being vegetarian since the end of 2018. I want to do more. I’m sharing content on my social media accounts, I’m following vegan accounts to stay informed, I’m even finally creating my health blog and will be offering a free e-book with most all info I can dig up on going vegan, including vegan resources, pages, groups, recipes, and brands. I feel damn good about this! 

Anyway, as I was thinking about all of this, I realized, I live in South Carolina, a huge region for fishing, barbecue, etc. and know one person who is a vegetarian. I’m wondering if there’s like, a site where I can find vegans near me? I would just love that fellowship because I feel so alone in my area. I’m also not working, 27F, and live basically off an old golf course surrounded by very rich people with nothing but time, so that also makes me feel more alone in this effort. 

Any tips are appreciated! I’m down for virtual friendships, but being able to say, be part of an activist group would feel freaking great, and I don’t know if there are any near me. 

That’s all! Thank you all and have a great day!",584908,1617371454,2021-04-02 21:50:54,1691672,7,1
vegan,mikoir,pinkamena_pie,"NPR Hidden Brain on Honor Culture, and how it relates to carnism","I listen to Hidden Brain almost every weekday on the road to work. There was a recent episode on what they referred to as Honor Culture. 

Honor Culture is the concept that you have to defend your position and reputation above all, with dire social consequences if you don’t. It traps you in a cycle of violence and being unable to admit when you are wrong. 

Examples ranged from the loss of the World Cup by France after the Italian star player called the French captain’s sister a whore (and he head butted him and was ejected from the game) to the examples in movies and media, so on. 

Everything I was hearing tracked with meat eaters being part of this example of honor culture. Inability to admit it’s wrong. Reacting violently with actions or words when confronted by the unpleasant truths. 

I highly advise giving it a listen and then responding with your thoughts. It may help us in speaking and working with carnist folks and getting actual change.",584907,1617371099,2021-04-02 21:44:59,1692027,6,1

Nellie/ Amla is found naturally in tropical and subtropical South Asian arid regions and mixed evergreen forests. It originates in the southern Himalayas of Nepal, from the northern part of India to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Medicinal properties 

 Ayurveda points out that Nellie contains all the flavors except salt. It contains the five flavors of sweet, acid, thorn, bitter and decoction. Nellie can be described as an equally beneficial medicine to alleviate the triads of va, pit and sem. 

 Nellie is also very good for pregnant mothers and helps to get rid of many complications during pregnancy. 

Nellie helps maintain normal levels of hormones in the liver, restores liver cells, controls cancer and inflammation, and maintains proper function throughout the body. Nellie is a good medicine to prevent allergies, improve body strength and strengthen the pulse, develop intelligence and control aging. Nellie is also good for dental disease. Nellie can also be used to reduce obesity and burn fat, as well as a remedy for gastrointestinal problems. Nellie also helps lower blood sugar levels.

Nellie is good for improving eyesight and alleviating eye diseases and also prevents premature graying of hair. Eating one or two Nellie nuts daily can help you to have a healthy glow-free hair as well as a healthy, dry skin. Nellie also contributes to the health of the hair as well as the scalp. Nellie will help you save the huge amount of money you spend on a variety of chemical ointments and medications, as well as get better results without side effects. Nellie is good for all the organs of a healthy person from head to toe.

Nellie tea is a hot drink made with Nellie powder. Nowadays, these herbal drinks are available in the market as standardized high quality products and it is commendable that these herbal drinks can be easily used instead of tea for the health of your life in a busy lifestyle. You can now use high acid antioxidant tea to burn unwanted fat and maintain a healthy body weight, as a natural beauty treatment and as a natural drink that is good for all the organs of the body. That Nellie tea drink is one of the easiest ways to add the amazing nutritional properties of Nellie to your body.

vegan,mib5bw,heckyouyourself,I told them I was serious. It went horribly.,"I tried putting my foot down and telling my parents I’m serious about going vegan. Both my parents immediately said what a horrible idea it is. But they followed that up by saying “but we totally support you.”

I started off by talking about the footage I’d seen and how it disturbed me. My dad said how that sort of thing was propaganda and designed to provoke a reaction, and he doesn’t wanna see me get “manipulated” by it. I said that if reality was provocative, that’s a problem. He said “that’s why you don’t wanna know how the sausage gets made. Literally. There’s no way to ethically feed billions of people.” 

My mom then said that the only reason humans are human is because our ancestors ate meat, and that we owe our advanced brains to animal protein. My dad said that it’s hard to be healthy while being vegan.

Then both my parents started talking about how the animals we consume are treated humanely before they die and how they’re killed just as humanely.

After telling me what a horrible idea it is to go vegan, my mom said “but look how much I already support you! I’ve been making plant based meals every now and then, and I buy so many vegetables!” She then said how most vegans are super unhealthy because they’re “junk-food vegans”, and that if I did go vegan “one day”, she’d make sure I wasn’t “one of those vegans”. I told her I’d be an adult by then and I wouldn’t need my mother choosing my food for me. I felt like the conversation wasn’t going anywhere so I walked off.

As I was leaving, my mom said “jeez. Was there a script you wanted me to read off of? I’m sorry I didn’t say what you wanted me to.”

Naturally I came back and told her that wasn’t what was going on, I just regretted saying anything to begin with and felt like we weren’t getting anywhere. I gave in and said I’d just wait to go vegan until after I left home.

She said “fine. Believe me, I can’t *wait* to stop cooking for you. Only two more years of this. I can’t wait.” I said “no one is forcing you to cook for us.” And I left, feeling like shit.

I’m pretty sure I heard them talking about me after I left. I don’t see why they can’t just accept my decision. It doesn’t effect them at all. It would have been one thing if I had asked them for their input, but I didn’t ask, I just told them what my decision was and they immediately started criticizing it. I’m 16 and can choose what I want to put into my body.

What are y’all’s thoughts on what happened? Did I do something wrong?? Why do I feel like shit???

vegan,mib4wb,throwingthisaway650,Vegan childhood memories.,"A recent post of bugs reminded me of this and I wondered if anyone had memories from their childhood that showed you had vegan ethics when you were young. 

One of my earliest memories is from when I was 3ish years old. I was playing on our patio and saw a lady bug. I remember wanting to see what would happen if I squished it.

Idk I knew it would squish but I think that I thought it would flatten and pop back up like in a cartoon. I took a plastic picnic table we had and crushed the ladybug. I still remember the sound. And when I picked the table up it was crushed and not moving. And it didn't pop back and I realized I had killed it.

That's as far as I remember but apparently I screamed really loud and my mom ran out because she literally thought I was being kidnapped or something. I was so inconsolable that I had hurt the lady bug... And clearly it was more than just childish overdramatization considering it's like my first memory. 

Idk it just makes me think that if we could let kids make their own choices they would never eat meat. It isn't in our nature to want to hurt animals at all. I also wanted to stop eating meat when I was a bit older and realized that people ate ducks and that the chicken I ate was animal parts...

Does anyone else have moments like that where looking back you can see that you had a sort of vegan ethical framework from the start?",584734,1617331187,2021-04-02 10:39:47,1731939,1,1

I adopted a friend’s chickens last summer. They were getting ready to move and couldn’t find a home for them so they were going to kill them and eat them. I was mortified so I took them in. They get tons of veggies, fruit, snacks, love, safety from local predators, space to roam, and access to their eggs for days at a time in case they need the nutrients from their eggs that they would normally eat in the wild. Whatever is leftover we’ve always eaten or shared with neighbors. They’re super friendly and come up to you for love and treats.

One person said that they should be set free but I can 100% promise you they would die in the wild.

Is it wrong to eat the leftover eggs that the chickens don’t eat themselves? Obviously you’re not vegan then, but at least your not supporting factory farming. Sooooo am I evil? Lol taking care of them and getting to know their little personalities has been so amazing and eye-opening.

My allergies are soy (yeah I know that's tough for Chinese food but I'm figuring out quite a lot of substitutes!), eggplant, avocado, yeast, garlic, and this isn't an allergy but I can't have wheat due to my Crohn's disease. Ginger also messes with me sometimes because of my Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, but it's not consistent. Yeah this is quite the list, I know. Hence why I'm struggling. I'm hoping I can at least find 2-3 recipes that I can adapt to meet my restrictions!

Thank you!",584729,1617329841,2021-04-02 10:17:21,1733285,4,1
vegan,mi87b1,xx8n_noxxmaN,Why do people feel that being vegan is inherently elitist?,"I see a lot of stuff on social media where people say being vegan is for affluent white people, even though I have heard that increasing veganism in the black community is at a higher rate and I have heard other POC from different ethnic backgrounds talk about family members making different vegan alternatives for recipes that are part of their heritage. I understand the type of white vegan that people are describing when they have a negative feeling to the term - I am probably more plant based than vegan because I don’t think I am 100% vigilant about every thing I use in my life, so this is more out of curiosity of people’s thoughts than personal reasons anyway. I think at the end of the day animal abuse / extinction and enviornmental damages are the primary concern, so if someone is passionate about industry issues but has some farm animals they use or goes fishing I am not probably going to talk down to them when discussing the matter. But it seems like when people say why they chose to go vegan and share some information about some issues, people get very upset and say that they are on a high horse, even if they asked why they don’t eat dairy or whatever. Any thoughts on this? Shouldn’t there be more focus on food accessibility in different areas and communities than demonizing not eating animal products?",584673,1617320895,2021-04-02 07:48:15,1742231,25,1
vegan,mi76n8,WaveLittle,"After 3 years of being vegan, I’m feeling really discouraged and ashamed.","More pros outweigh the cons to being vegan, and I did so for ethical reasons, but there are two cons that I’m really struggling to overcome:

1. How expensive it is when lacking the time or motivation to cook.
2. How easy it is to not get sufficient nutrients/calories.

The last year and a half I’ve been struggling with the calories factor. I’ve tried eating more peanut butter, avocados, olive oil, etc., but maybe I’m just crazy and can’t eat like that every day, multiple times a day

At this point, I feel like I’m too depressed to be motivated for basic upkeep of myself. As a result, my periods became so irregular, and I’ve lost so much weight and cannot gain it back. I’m almost borderline underweight. 

So I resorted to ordering food delivery literally everyday (I don’t have a car to do takeout and the spots I can eat at are not within walking distance), with a mixture of groceries because I don’t want to have strictly delivery. I’ve spent at least $3k in those 5 months on this, maybe even $4k. So I’ve been getting more calories in and my period went back to being regular. 28 days on the dot for 5 months straight. But my pockets are shot when I’m supposed to be saving to move out.

So the past few of months, I’ve been trying to force myself to cook and eat, and this is quick or easy kind of foods (throw it in an oven, microwave, etc.) but I don’t think anyone understands how hard these basic tasks are for me, especially if I need to cook more nutrient-dense, calorie-heavy foods. Plus, I can’t stomach even half as much home-cooked meals than I can with delivery. I get full fast, and half the time I lose my appetite altogether. 

People keep telling me to just start meal prep, toss food in a slow cooker, eat this, eat that, do X, Y, and Z. It’s not about what to do, it’s the effort. Now I feel so much pressure and like a failure because these basic tasks are no-brainers for the average person. But it’s a difficult chore for me.

Still, 3 months later trying to eat from home, and I thought I was doing good with it, but I’m still not eating enough calories. Some days I eat 2-3 times a day and only manage &lt;1k calories, some days I only eat once or not at all.

And now my period is late. Last month, my period came early at 26 days. I knew what this meant, and I’ve been trying to eat more, but now I’m 1 day late and still don’t feel the signs that it’s coming yet. This is what my periods have looked like in the past year: https://imgur.com/a/Mg9lKMV

Eating was a lot easier before I was vegan, because all the processed and fast food was cheap if need be while providing all the calories. Then I’d just take multivitamins. 

But being vegan is proving extremely difficult for me, and I’m hating myself so much for it. I went vegan for ethical reasons, so I simply cannot stomach the idea of eating animals, and I’m still struggling with eating enough. 

I’m not sure why I’m even writing here, but if anyone has words to share, I’d really appreciate it.",584655,1617317647,2021-04-02 06:54:07,1745479,31,1

vegan,mi42bq,CnelAurelianoBuendia,For vegan activism to be more impactful it must fundamentally change its approach,"I’ll start this off by making this clear: I’m on your side, I want your cause to succeed. Please read the rest of this post with this in mind, and approach it with open-mindedness and self-awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

During the past decade, veganism has become a viable, mainstream alternative to the traditional western omnivore diet, it is now more accepted than ever and its benefits are backed up by science. However, it still isn’t something completely normalized especially in developing countries and there’s still a lot of work left to do for environmental and vegan activists.

Now, in my opinion, the reason why this uphill battle is so much more difficult than it should be is that mainstream vegan activism is so overly aggressive that it turns potential “allies” into disassociated, indifferent assets. PETA, for better or worse, is the face of the vegan brand around the world, and its marketing approach is horrendously hostile, actively insulting people. Listen to this, You will NEVER change someone’s mind when you start a conversation with “You are wrong, stupid, and a bad person; here’s why…” call it immaturity, overly sensitivity, whatever, that fact remains true. That’s the same reason why climate change awareness is so difficult to get across people’s minds, very few people have the ability to be that introspective and take that amount of personal responsibility, to sacrifice something without a tangible reward for them.

You are right. You have the truth and the moral high ground on your side. Use that responsibly, use it as a tool and not as a weapon. Instead of sharing belligerent memes to “fight back” the status quo or the obnoxious, intolerant people that you have come across with; be patient instead. Create a platform and a space where people can feel safe talking to you and asking questions and seeking help. Most of us have been conditioned and indoctrinated to eat meat and dairy products. Stop acting like it's not hard, stop acting like it isn’t a hardship for some to leave something that brings them so much joy. I’ve lived in several countries throughout my life and you have no idea how out of touch you can sound when you nag people who are trying to quit meat gradually instead of instantly. In third world countries, vegan alternatives are much more difficult to acquire and the building blocks for a well-balanced, tasty diet without the help of animal-based products are simply not there sometimes. People find comfort in their favorite food and to take that away from them is going to be challenging but if you want to gain more followers in your movement I implore you to leave the self-righteousness behind and learn to be resilient. Ignorant people will give you shit, so what? Prove that you are in this for the right reasons and talk to them, teach them and be patient. It takes time for people to come around and find within themselves the answers and strength to take this kind of life-changing decision.

All of you together need to change your radical approach. I know that animals are being tortured to an incomprehensible level, but if you want to win this generational war, you need to do it with kindness and understanding. You may think it's dumb and that people should just “grow up” and do the right thing. Well, guess what: that’s not gonna happen by guilting them. That’s why there are so many visceral attacks against you, people are in denial and have protective mechanisms, you shall strip those down one at a time. You may be thinking “Changing people is not my responsibility” and you are right, this post is written for those of you who already had taken on that responsibility, who have already talked to your friends and family, and are active on social media, and donate, and volunteer your time.

Slow and steady wins the race. You are on the right side of history and if you know history you understand that these things are won by fighting methodically, not emotionally.

This is my feedback to you, I want this world to be better for the next generation and you are a big part of that, but you must change.",584605,1617308340,2021-04-02 04:19:00,1754786,36,1
vegan,mi3wy6,thatonealtchick,Why are some vegans resorting to harassment and bullying to try to get people to become vegan?,"I'm not saying it's all or most vegans, and I'm not trying to troll or start problems. I'm genuinely curious. Doesn't harassment seem to have the opposite effect? I get you feel strongly about veganism, but wouldn't it be smarter to be a bit subtle about it? In my experience, it seems to work better when it's more of a suggestion than a demand. I feel like a lot of vegan hate is because of those few who take it too far and it causes people to ignore the situation entirely. Maybe having a conversation about it and subtly bringing up the conversation will get a lot more people to want to at least become vegetarian. To me ""oh yeah veganism is pretty chill. There's a lot of benefits too"" sounds a lot better than ""meat-eaters are terrible people and are going to hell. become vegan or else you're shitty"" ofc the latter is really just an example and i don't think people say those exact words, but there are vegans who try to shove that belief down other people's throats.

vegan,mi2b4o,rechanen,Kids? Just say no,"&gt;Those who are unconvinced that the harm caused by the average child  to other humans is sufficient to support the anti-natalist conclusion  will have to reckon with the immense harm that humans do to animals.  More than 63 billion terrestrial animals and, by very conservative  estimates, more than 103 billion aquatic animals are killed for human  consumption every year. The amount of death and suffering is simply staggering.  
&gt;  
&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would think it wrong to breed new members of that species  
&gt;  
&gt;All this is caused by the human appetite for animal flesh and  products, an appetite shared by the great majority of humans. Using very  conservative estimates, every human (who is not a vegetarian or vegan)  is, on average, responsible for the death of 27 animals per year, or  1,690 animals over the course of a lifetime.  
&gt;  
&gt;Perhaps you think that by raising vegan children you can evade the  reach of the misanthropic argument. However, each new child, even if a  vegan, is very likely to contribute to environmental damage, one of the  means whereby humans harm humans and other animals. In the developed  world, the per-capita contribution to environmental degradation is  considerable. It is much lower in the developing world, but the much  higher birthrate there offsets the per-capita saving.  
&gt;  
&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would  think it wrong to breed new members of that species. The breeding of  humans should be held to the same standard.

vegan,mi2awq,Needredditshelp1,I try to help animals but have made plenty of mistakes in the process. Am I a bad person?,"Hi, like the other members of this sub I love animals and I often cry thinking of animals being killed. This feeling has caused me to buy 5 pigs in hopes of giving them a life outside of the slaughterhouse. My first 4 pigs i had to give to animal sanctuaries because I didn't have a place where the landlord was OK with them.

My mum often scolds me that I was wrong and irresponsible. I don't think she understands how deeply I love animals despite becoming a vegetarian after I became one aged 12. I honestly do not regret getting my first 4 pigs because the fact is they would be dead right now had I not bought them.

Right now I have my 5th pig. I will admit to you I didn't have permission from my landlord to get a pig but I was hoping my flatmates wouldn't mind. However one minded. The pig happened to run off at which point it was taken to a stable pending the ear tag which I then ordered. I have now collected the pig and taken it to pet boarding pending moving into a rented flat with a garden in a few days.

I am being totally honest here when I say i didn't look for housing until after having the pig, largely because I doubted any landlord would say yes but I couldn't take it any more thinking of innocent creatures dying.

I did spend some time with the pig for 4 days before it was at the stable or pet boarding. Another thing that made me worry I'm a bad person is that I took the pig on a walk and it only walked with me half the time and it plopped down and I dragged it a bit because it was too heavy to hold. It's 3 months old but it weights almost 35 kg. I then noticed part of its skin was bleeding and I felt really bad like wow this is my fault.

I also find myself flying by the seat of my pants because I find most online info too confusing to understand. However I have requested contact info for the farm from where the stable orders pig feed so I should be able to feed it properly going forward. This morning I fed it a whole easter cake. I felt a bit ashamed though that I googled can pigs eat dog food before taking my pig to the pet boarding.

I guess all this has made me feel like, I do have good intentions but I sometimes think I'm some sort of idiot because of all the trouble I get into with my piglets and I wonder if something is wrong with my brain.

I will say my pig liked me very much. It loved sitting on my lap and lying next to me. It loved spooning as well and often fell asleep next to me.

Anyways I'm open to suggestions.",584571,1617303441,2021-04-02 02:57:21,1759685,5,1

We talk regularly about veganism and she has made a lot of strides since we met to improve, but one thing I’ve noticed is that she always seems to mention the environmental/health benefits but very rarely does she verbally agree about the animal ethics side of things. 

Recently I just flat out said “it seems like we have different views on the ethical side of veganism” and she said that I was correct and that for whatever reason, the empathy just doesn’t click into her values. I’m a really non judgmental person and doing my best to stay open and encouraging, but that was a really hard realization to come across.

vegan,mhuzjd,ArryTheOrphanBoy,Why do people start arguing with you and then get mad when you defend your point of view?,"This drives me up the fucking wall. 

For example, 
I went to visit my dad and stepmother (farmers) last summer. 
I told them I was vegan so I wouldn’t be eating most of their food, I brought my own, no big deal right? 

My half-brother is a vegeterian slowly turning to veganism, so we were talking about it in the kitchen while my sister, brother in-law (also farmer) and stepmother were speaking to each other. 

When they heard what we were talking about they just HAD to start a debate about these things. I was pretty civil but they just were so fucking wrong about everything. 

They said the classic arguments: “we treat our animals well” and “that sort of treatment of animals doesnt happen in our country” and “where do you get your protein?” etc etc

Things got sort of heated on their end, I just quoted Earthling Ed mostly and defended my position. I didnt want to make things awkward so every fiber of my being went into being calm. 

Then my stepmother said: “We LOVE our animals” 
and I replied: “I dont believe you can love an animal, while killing it and profiting from their death”. 

I could tell it struck a nerve so I backed down but I could tell it made her very upset. 

Ever since she’s been very distant and cold to me.
I get it, I struck a nerve. 

But what I don’t get, is people who start a debate out of nowhere when I tell them Im vegan. Then when I defend myself and my position they act like Im “the crazy vegan who won’t shut up about veganism” 

They think I have no idea what Im talking about, that they’re smarter than me, that what they are doing is perfectly okay and that they can somehow “win” this debate with me, and I magically bow down to their intelligence since Im just a misinformed little girl. 

DONT START A FUCKING DEBATE, THEN GET MAD WHEN I MAKE MY FUCKING POINT. IF YOU WANNA ARGUE ABOUT THESE THINGS THEN MAKE SURE YOU’RE PREPARED TO HEAR MY POINT OF VIEW.",584490,1617282687,2021-04-01 21:11:27,1780439,34,1
vegan,mhtdns,tiggyandfoggy,"I've been plant-based a year - benefits, advantages, changes etc...","[https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/j43mpf/6\_month\_plantbased\_changes\_benefits\_advantages/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/j43mpf/6_month_plantbased_changes_benefits_advantages/)

I've linked my 6 month update above in case anyone wants to read it. I'm 35, British, male, and live in Rome, Italy. The Friday after we locked down here for covid (Friday 6th March) I idly wondered if I could manage to not eat dairy, meat or fish for a week - well, that felt good and manageable, so it became a month and now I'm a year in. Thought I should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it

weight - I lost it, I'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg (I didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan) - summer last year I'd sometimes be as little as 73 kg (but I think that's cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much). I've settled at about 75kg and I'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise

Muscle definition is better, more pronounced, I nearly have abs, waist goes in more, though I think I'm still using the same hole on my belt

Skin - far better, old marks (not scars, but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin, are fading or have faded completely. Mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too. 

Skin on body is also somehow softer/ smoother - tricky one to describe

skin on face - basically no breakouts now (fingers crossed) . I was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years, but now my skin is clear, though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose, but then we'll have half term (I'm a teacher) and I wear masks way less and it's clear that's just down to the masks

Last time, in the 6 month update I wrote about possibly being less wrinkly, dunno about that

face is definitely leaner though, cheekbones more pronounced

nose is less stuffy/ blocked - used to be I would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while I slept, now I don't need them

Think I'm sleeping better

Think possibly, I'm recovering faster when I do go for a run (my main form of exercises). I haven't been running regularly recently, but when I have I feel like that soreness I'd sometimes get in my thighs - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the name I think, is lesser than I might expect. It seems that plant-based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result - I'm hardly an example of this but did think I should say. About a month ago I managed to run 12k on Saturday morning and then 10 on the Sunday  - not sure I've done that much on successive days since Jan 2018 (I'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time, but ended up injuring myself). My usual run ( is 5-8 km), Wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either

My nails are growing more quickly, I'm basically wolverine

people talk about having more energy - I don't know about that, I've always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards (once was nicknamed the duracell bunny)

Possibly TMI stuff - so feel free to avoid

BO - dramatically reduced, to the degree that I don't bother with deodorant any more (before I used to use one of those deo blocks from lush). I don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything, but it does get hot obviously here in Italy, and even after i go running or whatever my tee-shirts and my armpits don't smell too bad

Digestion - I've never had a problem with constipation, always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit, but shall we say, I have even less of a problem now. Perhaps I used to make 1 or 2 ""sitting visits"" to the bathroom every day, now it's more like 3 or 4 - suppose I might be spending more on toilet paper - is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive? For the first few days though, digestion was interesting, I didn't have diarrhoea or anything, but ready access to a toilet was useful, luckily I was working from home - it even came out green a few times

Erections - feel like they're harder, perhaps last longer and perhaps that my ""recovery time"" is less. Used to be, after I came that'd be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours, but lately, I reckon round 2 might be on the cards. Also, I did wonder, months back, whether I'd gotten slightly bigger when hard, than usual, not so that anyone else would notice, it's not like I gained inches, but it felt slightly different in my hand - could just be that that's because it's harder, or maybe I really did gain something (in girth). This doesn't really matter, it could all be in my head (I typed hand there accidentally lol) it's not about to affect my relationship, the difference, if there is one, is minimal, but wanted to put it out there. Dunno if my cum tastes better, sorry. 

end of the TMI

Think eating plant-based has helped me with a long-term injury, I got illiotibial band syndrome in Jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it, and sometimes run, while takign care to try to not to worsen it. It seems almost healed now (plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory) - trouble is I complicated it on one of my occasional runs (before going plant-based) and managed to give myself hip bursitis/ trochanteritis - though this is also getting better, and I also attribute it's getting better partly to Time, the great healer, and partly to my diet. 

Honestly, I don't see myself eating meat, fish or dairy again, I'm really happy with my diet, and as time goes on, and now I find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling. My friends and family know I'm vegan, and I've been encouraging them to try it, colleagues at work know and gently take the piss, but they can see that I'm the healthiest person there I mean, I prob was before too, so for me that makes it more compelling - I didn't have too much spare weight on me as far as I was concerned, or any worrying health problems, but all these unexpected benefits happened. At the same time as safeguarding my future health, I'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly.

Some resources I've found really helpful are Mic the vegan on youtube

Michael Greger's how not to die book, and his website nutritionfacts

plant-based news on youtube is good too

vegan,mhs1ds,AnAudioHuman,Advice required,"Hello, r/vegan. I’m a meat eater but don’t judge me just yet. I’m actually looking for advice. 

You see, I’ve been watching some documentaries about veganism and stuff like animal cruelty, healthy lifestyles, etc. And in the past days it just hit me. I don’t want to be part of this lifestyle anymore. 

The latest documentary I watched was “Seepiracy” on Netflix, and it was just hard to watch. There was a quote that really resonated with me and it was a guy saying: “I don’t want to be attached with this activity” or something along those lines and that really struck to me. That’s how I feel right now about my diet. I eat a regular “omnivore” diet but I just don’t like the way things are done in the animal industry so I would like to stop my animal product consumption. Maybe it’s not much but I understand that every little step counts. So “I don’t want to be attached to that industry” anymore. 

So, my petition is as follows:

How can an omnivore start changing his diet? I’m looking for tips/ tricks/ hacks and recipes so I can start changing my diet and begin my transition but I jus don’t know how to do it. Sometimes I’m kinda afraid that I can’t do it but I really want to do this. Do you guys have any advice to kickstart a transition?

vegan,mhrons,Shazoa,Impact of Lab Grown Meat,"I need some help filling some gaps in my understanding.

I'm not particularly interested in consuming lab grown meat myself. After being vegan for a while the appeal of it just vanished. I don't even really like plant based imitation meat if it's *too* close to the real thing because it weirds me out. But I do understand not everyone feels the same, and it is potentially very important as either a gateway or a means for the wider population to go vegan.

So I was thinking about this and I realised that I don't know enough about the potential environmental impact. Lab grown meat *should* be at least a little more efficient, surely? There's always going to be some kind of inefficiency in converting plant matter into animal matter, but animals also do all sorts of crazy things that farmers deem unnecessary like moving or having any quality of life.

Here's what I need more help with: is the saving good enough?

For example, some plant based foods are more environmentally damaging to produce than others. Does lab grown meat compare to some of the 'worst' plant based foods? Is it much worse? Is it better? Is it *sustainable*? If all of the world's meat eaters suddenly switched to consuming lab grown meat, but didn't reduce their intake, would the sky still fall?",584453,1617269734,2021-04-01 17:35:34,1793392,14,1

vegan,mhqwcm,BikingInBasel43,Crucial nutrients for vegans,"I made this list as an answer to another post here, but I'll post it again, since I think this list is interesting for everyone.

This list of crucial nutrients for vegans are made for europeans. Selenium for example is no problem for people who are living in places with selenium rich soils like canada or huge parts of the US. I also wrote down how I recommend getting these nutrients. 

Very Very Crucial:
- Vitamin B12 (supplement)

Very Crucial:
- Vitamin D (not just for vegans; people who don't live in sunny areas of the World should supplement it)
- Iodine (also depends on your location; i recommend a supplement since the Iodine content in algae is hugely varying)
- DHA (seeds with high ALA contents like flax, chia or hemp, if you are worried about your conversion rate, better supplement it together if EPA)

Crucial:
- zinc (legumes, pumpkin/sunflower/chiaseeds, some nuts etc.)
- EPA (Same as DHA, but less crucial, because ALA is converted easier into EPA than into DPA)
- selenium (this depends on your local soil, I recommend a supplement, because the selenium content of brazil nut are hugely varying)

Less crucial:
- iron (seeds, dried apricots, oat, legumes, etc.)
- vitamin B2 (found in small parts in many foods, so it should add up even if you never thought about your B2 intake, very good sources are mushrooms and almonds)
- calcium (plant Milk with extra calcium, greens, many other vegetables, nuts, mineral water, etc.)
- vitamin K2 (can be converted from K1, best source is kale) 

Not really crucial, but worth mentioning:
- protein (legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, etc)
- lysine (most crucial amino acid for vegans and one of the many reasons you should eat your legumes every day, some seeds also have huge amounts)
- energy (you should consider eating more, since vegan foods tend to have a lower calorie density)

Also notice that Vitamin A is easy to get from conversation from beta carotene, but some people (I think one in 10.000, but idk the exact number) can't convert beta carotene properly, these people should consider eating more carots, sweet potatoes and pumpkins or taking a retinol supplement.

For five days, I’ve been obsessively following the animals that are being left to die in the Suez Canal. The thought of the heat, the excruciating discomfort, thirst, and hunger, standing in their own feces... I’m a wreck. If an article pops up and I read it, I have the urge to smash my phone on the wall. I’m furious this is happening and that there’s nothing I can do. I can’t find a way to help, a way to donate. I know they are going to their death either way, but slaughter is less cruel than starvation and high heat. Any time I see stories like this, like when pigs were being inhumanely killed en masse during the pandemic because demand for bacon went down, or when I watch a documentary on the livestock industry, I’m a wreck. Which is a problem, because part of my job for 5 years has been to teach students about animal agriculture. I cry every day after school during that unit. I’ve been vegan for over ten years. I help run a farm sanctuary that someone else started. I can’t do anything else. I’ve sunk all my money and time into helping these animals. I left my first job because I couldn’t stomach animal testing and the dead beagles I’d pass every day in the freezer, even if I wasn’t directly involved. Knowing there were puppies who would spend their short lives in a cage being fed research chemicals right next to my lab left me suicidal.  I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t save them. I couldn’t even go in to look at them.  There’s so much unnecessary, human-inflicted suffering in the world, and I have a hard time keeping a level head about it. I know it’s not helpful. But I hate not being able to help. Sometimes I feel like if I suffer with them, if I starve, if withhold water from myself, maybe I’ll feel less worthless. But that’s mental illness. I don’t know how to cope. How do you cope? How do you watch the videos and keep up with the news? I used to slaughter pigs before I started rescuing them. I was a different person.

You can tell it came out 10+ years ago, because all the online reviews about it are just omnivore dorks complaining that it doesn't have cheese.

\- Dark chocolate chunk Luna bars. I don't know how the hell these got discontinued! They were delicious!

Right now I eat meat 2-3 times a week and animal products are like 90% of my diet and honestly I find it hard for me to stop consuming all of that. So I ask you: how did you do it? Did you remove everything overnight or did you opt for a slower transition? I would be forced to take supplements or are there any surrogates for those nutrients present in animal food/products?

Sonic is almost never violent towards other sentient beings (again, until later games that got edgier), and only destroyed machinery (as far as I remember) across the whole of the classic trilogy (I guess he fights with Knuckles in 3&amp;K, but it’s not really violent, it’s more kinda just the two butting heads. Knuckles gets back up and is fine after like 5 seconds.). Also, Sonic 3&amp;K is an anti-imperialist story (as many post-WWII Japanese stories are, for obvious cultural reasons), with Knuckles being the victim of theft of his indigenous mineral wealth (the Master Emerald). 

Mario is a pawn in the conflict between the Toadstools and the Koopas. He hails to the hierarchy of feudalism, and is deeply violent, crushing sentient beings to death under his own weight, possibly scorching or freezing them alive, or causing blunt force trauma by method of a raccoon tail, shell, or other thrown object. Whether or not the “enemies” intend to harm him is irrelevant, as he can easily outmaneuver their relatively ineffective attempts to do so. And what is Mario’s goal?

vegan,mhez1g,Woody-ddit,A story about social deconstruct,"Hello there fellow vegan,

https://preview.redd.it/96csy5nk1fq61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aa778ea8ba7325774f50459cd935320f98df0a6

So what's that ? A pizza. One that is vegan and cheese free.  
So what ? So begin the story of an individual who knocked down everything he knew about how the things are supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Veganism changed my take on pizza. When I made my first vegan pizza years ago, **I was sooooo attached to put cheese replacement**. That's how it is supposed to be, that's how tradition works, that's how it will be. Oh god... I had hard time to swallow those industrial vegan cheese. My tummy was not happy. Years later, I now make pizza without cheese. Some people around me feel like it's not ""real"" pizza, because we don't have the pleasure of that melted cheese string growing as you try to tear it the higher you raise it. And I get it. It was 30 years of habits that I had to put aside. I loved every single cheese string. But pizza (sorry dear italian) can be and will from now on (for me at least) be enjoyed without cheese or any kind of replacement. It *just* requires to deconstruct what society told you pizza should be. As the song says : ""**make your own kind of pizza, topped it with your own special parts""** or something like this. I don't know 😊

&gt;For those who don't have the song reference, here it is : [https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8](https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8)

I know. I know. ""Dude, it's just a freaking pizza..."". I guess you are right. But this pizza right here is the results of years of years of social deconstruct. Not just veganism, oh no. I wish it was that simple. It catapulted me in a world I never though to discover. A world where I had to deconstruct my whole social world.

It's a muscle. Every time I watched a documentary on veganism, that muscle activated. Doubt everything, question everything. Is this how things are supposed to be ? Why male character have more dialogue time in Disney than female one ? Are electric cars really that green ? Are we supposed to be all boy / girl ? Why should asian should be good at math and ""rice eater"" when I eat more rice than 80% of the one I know ? Should I eat this boeuf bourguignon at Christmas because we've been doing it since I was born ? Why is it that I should have a kid by now ?

It may be be far-fetched. I mean, the guy is writing about LGBTQIA+, about food, about relation between men and women (and all those in-between, my bad I'm not familiar enough yet). Well it all boiled down to that one simple thing : social deconstruct.

30 years of having meat every meals. 30 years of drinking milk because ""they are our friends"" (french ads). 30 years of considering meat manly and vegetables an option. And so much more.

I am thankful for veganism. Not because I live an (almost) cruelty free lifestyle, but because I had to deconstruct the world around me and ended up more humble about my life as a white guy in a developped country, and compassionate for those who must endure.

For a great number of people, being vegan is about the animals and the cruelty. I'm not completely there yet but someday I will. God I hate those ingredients list that ends with 0.01% of powedered milk. For now, it is about deconstructing everything I know about the world I was raised in.

And that, dear readers, is a pizza which has been socialy deconstructed and rebuilt from scratch. Well almost, I still make them round most of the time, with tomato sauce and all but you got the idea. The best I have every week for several months now. One day I'll be fully vegan, one deconstruction at a time.

Not sure about the goal of this post, probably some make my ego blush a tinny little bit but I also hope it could serve some people to tackle way more than veganism in their path.

If you compare it to gluten-free foods, most foods that don’t contain gluten say it right on the packaging, which is great and very helpful to people with gluten allergies. I wish it was more industry-standard to also have a vegan label.

I was reading about it, and there doesn’t appear to be as many industry standards around labeling something as vegan, but there are definitely products out there that do, usually those that are “intentionally” vegan or marketed to vegans/vegetarians.

A) all drugs you buy come from probably come from some kind of gang, that will engage in violence with their competitors which causes a great deal of suffering,

B) plantations that grow cocaine,heroin and other drugs use slave labour which is obviously not vegan,

C) I’m personally ok with people taking whatever shit and shite they like as long as they know what’s in it, it’s what it gets cut with that I have an issue with. Given that the process of cutting causes the drugs to become way more dangerous and cause suffering, is it vegan?

We know what we are doing. We know where we are heading. And we know it's nothing good.

But we can do something. We can change our destiny. We can evolve. We can save our planet and save ourselves.

Going Vegan is the single best step that we can take in order to reach this future and reduce our carbon footprint. And if we take all the other steps, too, like switching to renewable energy and recycling, we can be sure that one day our kids will be proud of us, because we granted them a sustainable future, or better, because we granted them a future.

Furthermore, by going Vegan we save billions (yes, you read it right, billions...) of animals from being raped, slaughtered, tortured, abused and killed. There's absolutetly no reason that can justify all of this. It's wrong. It's stupid. It's dangerous. It's evil. It must be stopped.

Last, but not least, Veganism can help humans right now, not only the future ones. Think of all the people who work in slaughterhouses. The majority of them suffers from PTSD, and will probably suffer from it for the rest of their life.

This is why Veganism is the next step in human evolution. This is why I encourage anyone who is reading this and is still not Vegan to go fully Vegan right now. And this is why I thank everyone who already is Vegan and is building our future. Thank You.",584223,1617210477,2021-04-01 01:07:57,1852649,2,1
vegan,mhae2q,d00leys,''Othering'' and not being a terror vegan,"Hey guys! I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the following subject.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally a very easy-going person. People know I am vegan but I don't push it. I will bring my own snacks for others to try at gatherings, but I don't comment on what other people eat (except with close friends and family). I think this is, in general, a healthy approach. However, at one point I noticed I kind of excuse my veganism. Like yeah, I'm a vegan. But I'm not like *those* vegans. 

&amp;#x200B;

It reminded me of coming to terms with being gay. I'd say stuff like - Yeah, I am gay, but I'm not, *you know.* But why? Why am I dilluting myself to fit in with a group (omnis, straight people), when I should just be unapologetically myself? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on this fun little personal journey called: growing a spine. And I'm curious about other people's thoughts on this subject. So tell me: are you a terror vegan? How outspoken are you, and do you feel like it gets you anywhere or does it turn people off veganism? Do you identify with vegans as a whole?",584217,1617209621,2021-04-01 00:53:41,1853505,38,1

I have read a good deal about veganism for health, but the info seems to be more generalized, so was hoping someone might have some personal experience with this. 

I have endometriosis and it is not very well controlled with medications. Most people think it's just painful period cramps, but I don't even get a period and am usually in like, excruciating pain almost everyday. There is a lot more involved, but that is the gist of it. It sucks.

I have been looking a lot into dietary changes to help and have even tried a few different protocols myself, such as low fodmap, AIP etc. Most of these diets are fairly low-carb and nearly impossible to sustain on a vegan or even vegetarian diet. I was actually a vegetarian for 16 years and eventually started eating meat about 4 years ago at the advice of my medical team, RDs, etc. so that I could follow these plans. But I just don't buy the idea that eating a meat-heavy diet is helpful, especially considering all of the hormones and antibiotics animals are given, and it goes against so much of my morals and ethics. I am trying to avoid a hysterectomy (I'm only 30!!) and was just so desperate.

Has anyone had any success with veganism helping endometriosis symptoms? At this point I will probably head toward veganism either way, but was hoping for some insight and maybe some hope, haha.

I haven't watched it, but it does come up if you type in any vegan documentary into the Netflix search bar, so I was curious to know if other vegans think its worth watching or talking about (considering how everyone has been buzzing about the new Seaspiracy documentary here).

Documentaries like Earthlings and Dominion center around animal welfare and ethics, so they are really pro vegan and environment, whereas Cowspiracy, What the Health, and Game Changers really just focus on the human experience in terms of health and fitness. The don't really dig deeper to question morality and speciesism. The two documentaries that present the strongest ethical cases are the two that Netflix does not offer. It's good that Netflix has a few plant based diet documentaries, but I really hope they open their catalog to more bitter truths. I'm going to be watching Seaspiracy this week, but judging from the trailer I can tell it's not really about the animals, its about the pollution and industry agendas as a whole. Which is fine, but that really is only the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully I am wrong about this assumption and it really does create a voice for the animals that are suffering and being slaughtered.

Netflix plays a major role in a lot of people's worldly education, just because of their extensive list of easily accessible documentaries.

I’ve just been eating at home and cooking for myself + eating my grandmas cooking.

Not sure if I should just give in at this point for one day ? or Just try to get over the temptation or just stop the no gluten no added sugars thing",584004,1617147215,2021-03-31 07:33:35,1915911,5,1
vegan,mgsx5t,shinzu-akachi,I turned meat eater to vegan because of Alex O'Connor(cosmic skeptic on youtube) and Earthling Ed.,"(i posted this to the cosmic skeptic (youtube dude and vegan) reddit about a week ago and then just found this sub. Being the upvote whore that i am, i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared :p)

This post ended up being really long and rambling, so im adding this at the start. TL;DR i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of Alex's arguments for veganism, and the documentary ""land of hope and glory"" by Earthling Ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making.

I dont know if he reads anything on this sub, but if by any chance Alex sees this, then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point.

Ive been watching for a while, mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years, and honestly, when he first started doing veganism related content, i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention. But something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully, and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument (at least for someone in my position) for consuming animal products in the way i did. I resisted at first, mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of ""well, im such a small cog in the machine, what im doing makes no REAL difference""...But i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat. This lasted, i think, several months.

Then roughly a week or so ago, i sat down (with a pork sausage sandwich) and started browsing youtube videos, and i come across podcast #9 with Earthling Ed ([https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04](https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04)). I watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as (what i now recognize to be...) my cognitive dissonance starts to break down. Partway through the video Earthling Ed's documentary ""land of hope and glory"" was mentioned (i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview - link to the documentary &gt; [https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)) and i was curious, so i paused that video and googled it, and started watching. The pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point.

As much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this, i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life. I had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals, about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut, or how pigs were put into gas chambers. But i had never actually been confronted with it. Never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death. Or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture-porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death. And as silly as it sounds, i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch, but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal. And i simply could not finish that sandwich, i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point, but i just couldn't stomach it.

And from there, the floodgates had opened, i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore, then milk and cheese were off the table too, since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons. Fish i found were more difficult to empathize with, and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish, until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was. ""can fish really feel pain? i swear i read they couldnt..."" a quick google informed me that, yes, fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain, duhhhhh. And of course i realized that ive always found the Japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic, so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones?

Ive not been vegan long now, as i said, about a week. But honestly, what has surprised me most is this...ITS SO EASY. I had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous ""taste martyr"" to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life... and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised, if i didnt know better, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS MEAT. Alternative cheese, butter, milk, chicken, sausages etc... it all tastes really good?! What the hell?! Why isnt this better known?! As for health, my diet has been quickly improving, im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar (im far too addicted to fizzy drinks) But im eating far more leafy greens, veg and fruit, and im really enjoying it!

The only problem im having now is trying not to be the ""preachy vegan"" to my family. I dont know whats right at this point, to live and let live, or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me. I almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused.

This was wayyyy longer than i meant to make it and if you made it this far, thankyou for listening to my rambling.",584005,1617147113,2021-03-31 07:31:53,1916013,7,1

I often get comments like 'well not all farms are like that' or 'its completely natural to eat meat'.

Ive referred them to documentaries and various sources but it feels like Im getting nowhere. Im in no way trying to force them to change, but often get in needles arguments, if anything food or animal related gets mentioned.

vegan,mgrry1,Princy04,Question regarding the conscious of omnivores.,"In Frederick Douglass's autobiography *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave*, a common theme is that Douglass believes the institution of slavery was not only abhorrent for the slaves themselves, but also polluted the hearts and lives of the white owners. He wrote the following about a Master Hugh:

&gt;My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. 

*Douglass 43*

He later states;

&gt;. . . for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; . . .  

*Douglass 52*

Have any of you seen or experienced similar parallels? I'm not looking for health benefits, rather a greater character and psyche from rejecting animal cruelty. Thanks!",583993,1617143501,2021-03-31 06:31:41,1919625,2,1
vegan,mgrh27,artlanta,I’m officially going Vegan. After watching “Seaspiracy”... my lifelong love of seafood and meat crumbled before my eyes. It’s time for me to stand up and do what’s right.,"I have two younger sisters that have been Vegan for years and they have tried to get me to do the same... but I just never wanted to do it! I guess I tried to ignore *how* my food got to me because the reality was a little hard to stomach. So naturally, as a selfish human, I repressed the facts and continued to indulge in animal products. 

This morning, all of that changed. Watching “Seaspiracy” on Netflix literally broke my heart. I love my planet... I love the ocean, I love the whales? I love the dolphins, the sea turtles, the fishies.... but how dare I ever say that if I am contributing to the extinction of the most gentle creatures in the sea?!? 

As the documentary ended, my stomach initially churned with disgust in myself. “No more seafood!” I said to myself.  But then instantly, I remember one of the whale poachers saying that he saw it no different than the meat industry... and he has a damn good point. 

I love animals. I love this planet. I want to do whatever it takes to save it... and despite my LOVE for meat (like, you guys have no idea, I love LOVE love seafood and meat), I’m ready to put it behind me. I’ve tasted some delicious plant based alternatives before, as per the generosity of my sisters... so I know that I’ll be able to continue enjoying the juicy flavors and textures of our fuzzy and fishy friends. Plant based foods have come such a long way!! 


I know this is probably a very boring and jumbled post... but I don’t have anyone to really talk to about it right now and I feel like such a new woman already. I’m ready to do my part and I just hope that the whole world can begin to fee this way, too. 

I’m going in for the whole nine yards. NO animal products, not just food, will ever be purchased by myself or my boyfriend ever again. I can’t believe it took me so long... but I’m glad I finally got here. 

I’m ready to do my part to save the planet.",583989,1617142610,2021-03-31 06:16:50,1920516,230,1

vegan,mgqexx,VioletIsntHere,"Something hit me today, and I can’t believe I’ve never thought of it before.","So we all know there’s a large number of people out there who won’t go vegan because they just refuse to believe that animals are exploited and treated badly in animal agriculture industries. And it kind of makes sense. Most of us didn’t realise how bad it was either, until we did some research and went vegan ourselves.

But then I realised.

NOBODY is denying that humans are exploited in big industries. People don’t deny the existence of sweat shops, and child labour, and poor working conditions, and slave labour. We all know that people suffer for capitalistic gain.

So why do we have such a hard time believing that animals suffer too? 

Animals are even more voiceless. Even easier to ignore. Of COURSE in a society that can’t even treat humans humanely we’re not going to treat animals with compassion.

I just can’t believe I didn’t think of this sooner.",583971,1617139485,2021-03-31 05:24:45,1923641,11,1
vegan,mgpn7b,mysinfulsorrow,Honest question about this sub and how unwelcoming it seems.,"On mobile so the formating my be wonky.

Like most people I've eaten meat all my life. I met a good friend online who's been vegan for about 5 years now. He's helped me find alternatives and been very welcoming and accepting that changing your entire lifestyle is difficult much like changing your religion isn't an overnight rewire of your brain. I know veganism is more than a diet, its an ethical at its core. Ive been looking for resources and groups to help me keep my mind on the goal of being a better person and helping build a better world for animals and humans alike. 

I still have thoughts of eating meat and can't seem to tear the wall down between the animals I want to save and the cravings I still get. Ive changes almost all of my diet apart from eggs and fish which are the last 2 mental walls I have to overcome but I still crave meat.

 This brings me to the question I posed in the title. Why does this subreddit seem so hostile? From the posts I've read I expect to be called names and down voted for my curiosity. Not everyone is the same, in the same place mentally, or wired the same way. Some people need support and help and you'd think the subreddit devoted to this cause would be more welcoming to changing hearts and minds. 

Im really anxious about posting this, I usually lurk across all of reddit but this means a lot to me and am disappointed to see this behavior from people I wish to be like.",583957,1617137311,2021-03-31 04:48:31,1925815,29,1

Realizing the moral implications of meat eating it is like waking up from a fever dream in cold sweat. It's like those horror stories where the protagonist came out of a trance induced by some Lovecraftian menace, and realize that everyone else is still in that trance, and are being controlled to slaughter and torture for pleasure. You desperately cry unto them, pleading, begging for everyone to wake up, to recognize what's happening, only to be met by zombie-like, reactionary out-lash.

When you truly understand what the animal products industry is doing, outrage, frustration and despair are **the most natural** response.

vegan,mgk9fh,Beknbee,I'm curious - why did you choose to go vegan and would you eat eggs if they were your own free-range chickens?,"Hello! 

Obligatory ""I'm not a vegan"", but I've been enjoying more tofu and plant-based meals as of late. I still don't mind eating meat, but I prefer not to when I have the option.

I did have a genuine question though. If you raised your own chickens just for fun, would you eat their eggs? I ask because I used to raise poultry (not for meat purposes), and they were always producing eggs. The hens, if no rooster was present, would rarely be broody (they were rarely broody even with a rooster), so the eggs were just left in the nest. I understand going vegan out of concern for animals and their treatment, but in this case, no animal is being harmed and it keeps animals like snakes and raccoons out of your coop because they know there are no eggs. Is there anything that makes eating these eggs unethical in your eyes, or would it be okay because you own these chickens and they're free-range - not being forced to live in terrible conditions to maximize production?

I'm just genuinely curious! I choose vegan options at the store when possible (if I have the budget for it since it can get expensive), but I spent the majority of my childhood raising chickens and just couldn't get this question out of my head. **I do understand not wanting to buy eggs in the store because of the horrible conditions they keep chickens in.** 

(I would also just genuinely like to know what made you choose to go vegan, questions aside! Did you start out vegetarian first, or did you hop right in?)

I hope none of my questions offend and thank you for taking the time to read this! I just want to become more educated on the topic and understand it from a different perspective.

*Processing video b86onllzv6q61...*

Hi Everyone,

**This is about her survival and how you can help**

Vivek here, the person in the video is my sister, Kriti. I will try to make this as short as possible, but at the same time, request you to read this entirely.

**Since past 10 years, my sister has been fighting BLOOD CANCER - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,** it is very dangerous disease which requires weekly blood test, chemo meds and hospital visit, she has been visiting hospital every month for past 10 years.

Now, her disease has progressed to **Advance Stage** as she developed drug-resistance towards all chemo medicine available.  
**She has suffered enough pain, needles and dreading hospital visit in past 10 years, please understand the pain and come forward.**

Only solution for us is if she finds a ""**TISSUE-TYPE"" matching BLOOD STEM CELL DONOR, who can donate few amount of stem cells (just like donating PLATELETs) which help** cure her Blood Cancer.  
**There is no ORGAN OR SURGERY INVOLVED.**

**ISSUE IS:**

* Finding a match is extremely rare. **1 in MILLION** as very few people are registered in stem cell registry.
* People don't realize that everyone ""tissue type"" is **unique and rare,** and only 2-3 people matches with one another in the entire world, so unless they register we can't find match. So by not registering they are not including their tissue type to be matched against her or someone who's cancer you can cure.
* We have tried everything in **past 9 months to get a match, still unable to find one, but her cancer cells are growing rapidly.**

**IMPORTANT: How you can help?**

* You can take a **free swab test, which are delivered to your home to see** if your **""TISSUE TYPE""** is matching with her. **ANY BLOOD GROUP can be a match. (Age: 18-50).**

vegan,mgixda,DealerProfessional20,keeping old leather textiles?,"I still have some old leather shoes, jackets, and belts, and I don't think I want to get rid of them. I feel guilty wearing them, and feel some shameful obligation to hide them (to ""prove"" I'm vegan now), but in my logical mind I feel like no longer using those things would be wasteful and the thought of getting rid of them somehow makes me feel worse. I feel like I have a responsibility to get as much use out of them as I can to prevent waste of the animals products I already have, that are decades old. It may be against the vegan moral philosophy to continue to utilize these things, but I'm personally significantly less concerned with something as abstract, emotional and personal as moral consistency as I am with reducing actual harm and improving conditions for everyone.

Is there is a good philosophical justification for ceasing use of old leather stuff? I've reflected on why I feel guilt anyway and I've decided that it's all just emotional guilt with its only basis in some ""code"", and no basis on my actual impact on the world on the result. Avoiding waste seems like the most positive action I can take. I wanted to know what you guys think.",583856,1617119096,2021-03-30 23:44:56,1944030,1,1

vegan,mg5a4k,knightfluttershy,On the suffering of wild animals,"While the 100 billion land animals + 3.5 trillion fish murdered every year by humans is of course the primary concern, as it should be. We should focus on alleviating the suffering of the animals that are slaughtered entirely needlessly and gratuitously before all else, and I’m not trying to take away from that. 

I still think the suffering of wild animals is something that ought to be taken into account, if not now, then in the future. 

Elephants have only one set of teeth. In the wild, elephants who grow too old die of starvation, because their teeth have worn out. This does not happen in captivity, because they are given special attention, and are allowed to peacefully die of old age. 
Don’t all elephants deserve this fate? I would certainly argue there is not a single elephant that deserves to starve to death, yet this happens quite regularly. 

There are a lot of arguments against humans alleviating animal suffering, but I think only one works: we do not yet have the technology to prevent wild animal suffering on a large scale without doing tremendous harm to the environment. However, I do not believe this will always be the case, and I think every other argument made against it is extremely unconvincing. 

1) Argument: This is anthropomorphic, because “good” and “bad” are human terms

Refutation: An elephant dying of starvation in a field of grass is bad. If you disagree with this point then I’m not sure anything can be done to convince you otherwise. 

2) Argument: Humans should not interfere with nature. This is arrogance. 

Refutation: Humans interfere with nature ALL THE TIME. We’re currently causing the biggest mass extinction in 65 million years. Every time we take medication, we are “interfering with nature”. Every time we chop down a tree we are “interfering with nature”. When we do something awful, something that’s catastrophic on a global scale, cruelty-apologists look the other way, but when we suggest doing something that prevents suffering in animals they’re all “oh let’s not interfere with nature!” Give me a break. 

Wild animals who have undergone predator attacks suffer from PTSD. Nature is generally a terrible place, thriving on suffering. Granted, places like slaughterhouses are infinitely worse, as they’re designed to cause permanent suffering, but we shouldn’t let bad things happen ONLY because there are worse things going on.",583715,1617069563,2021-03-30 09:59:23,1993563,11,1

vegan,mg47xq,cannibal_chanterelle,Is Seaspiracy drawing the wrong conclusions from all the right evidence?,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet because I'd rather see discussion than read my own thoughts. Obviously, the main conclusion to the documentary is that sustainable farming, only sustains the problem and veganism is the way we can fight against our extinction. Let's be honest, that's what we are facing. Extinction.

But is this reductive or at least, is this not seeing the forest for the trees? Global capitalism is the reason humans are incentivised to fish animals into extinction, to force people into lives of slavery, to overproduce diseased meat for the cheapest cost to maximize profit. Why doesn't the documentary finger global capitalism as the root cause for coming ecological collapse? While I agree that veganism is certainly an important part of reversing climate catastrophe, as long as capitalism is in place, this wholesale, devil may care destruction of the planet and its organisms will continue.

Are there any counter thoughts on this? If the film was right to couch veganism as the solution to mass extinction, explain it to me. My big gripe with the film is that it seems almost dismissive of the larger economic structures that allow this to continue (besides noting that these fishing industries are huge money sinks and corrupt as all fuck).",583695,1617066020,2021-03-30 09:00:20,1997106,22,1

vegan,mg1din,DonSmo,A Discussion on Zoos,"I know I'll probably get a lot of hate for this, but it's something I need to get off my chest and am genuinely interested if people are willing to have an adult conversation about this.

As a vegan and animal lover, I also... don't hate zoos. I follow a lot of vegan pages on instagram, watch vegan youtubers and over and over I see nothing but hate for zoos. Saying they should all be closed, and that everyone who visits one should be cancelled etc. Usually attached to some old photos from third world country zoos with animals living in horrible conditions. 

My belief is that in an ideal world, zoo's wouldn't exist and every animal would live freely in it's natural habitat. But sadly, we don't live in an ideal world, we live in a world filled with pollution, habitat destruction, hunting, mass scale farming, over-fishing destroying the oceans. And in this world zoo's sadly are vital for the care of wild animals. 

I work in this industry, and see it all from the inside, so I find it upsetting when some vegans are so quick to judge and so short-sighted on zoos. I work in a small town wildlife sanctuary. At this sanctuary yes, we do have animals on display that are captive animals and can't be released to the wild. And yes we charge people tickets to enter because that's the only funding we get. But behind the scenes we have a hospital where we rescue, rehab and release wild animals. Hundreds per year, who never see the public and have limited contact with humans. 

And what do we do when we get a case we can't handle? We take it to the zoo. We are a small establishment with limited facilities, but we have a good relationship with the local zoo which has an amazing big animal hospital.

We get everything from pelicans with fishing wire down their throats to wombats who have been hit by a car. But one thing is consistent to almost all of our rescues, and that is that they are needing to be rescued because of interference from humans in one way or another. We caused the problem, so we feel the need to help fix it. Also, my sanctuary is almost entirely volunteer run. We work long hours, mostly outdoors in all sorts of weather for zero pay, just because we are passionate about helping animals. 

I also recently visited another much larger wildlife sanctuary in a different state, which had about 200-300 animals on display, but in 2020 alone they rescued, rehabed then released 14,000 wild animals. Just in one year! And the truth about this is that no one else can really do this but zoos. People take injured native wildlife to vets, but vets rarely know how to treat animals outside of cats and dogs, and they usually just sit in a cage until they can be transferred to a zoo or specialised wildlife carer. 

Between breeding programs of endangered animals, to all the rescue work with zoo hospitals, to the extensive conservation work done worldwide to help ensure the future of wildlife etc zoos are now vital to our world if you like animals. I see this all from inside the industry so it's kind of frustrating to see vegans pointing to things like Tiger King or third world zoos' or other horrible, abusive attractions and using those to say all zoos are evil and should be closed. If all zoo's closed overnight it would be devastating for the world's wild animals. It's the sad truth. Zoo's aren't all made equal. Worldwide yes, there are some horrific, sad, abusive zoo's and wildlife ""Attractions"" that I wish would close as much as anyone, but that shouldn't diminish the good amazing zoos and the people who work at them. 

TLDR: I wish vegans would actually research what goes on at Zoos before judging them all so harshly, or judging them all by the worst examples of zoos on the planet.",583649,1617057076,2021-03-30 06:31:16,2006050,25,1

vegan,mfx38q,kuracaos,"Did anyone else have ""vegan"" realizations as a kid?","I remember when I was 5 or 6 years old, my parents took me on a boat trip during a holiday. After we got off the boat and took a stroll around the dock, I saw some men ""scaling"" fish with the back of a knife. It was a violent scraping, and scales were flying in the air. But the fish were still alive during the process, they were wildly flopping around on the workbench as the men tried to hold them down. As a little kid seeing this, I was utterly distraught and it literally traumatized me to some degree. The memory and the sheer callousness of it is still etched into my mind. 

A few years later when I was around 8, my mom had gone grocery shopping and prepared a dinner for the family. When she called me to the table, there was a rack of lamb sitting on a platter. Seeing the little ribcage on our table like that, is when the connection between the animal and my food suddenly became really salient. It wasn't food, it was part of a corpse. I remember being horrified, protesting to my parents about it, storming to my room crying. I knew how precious lambs were and would have done anything to protect them. Since then I had an aversion to any type of meat with visible bones in it. 

(Sidenote: My grandpa had a flock of sheep, and in the springtime I'd get to go and play with the lambs. Years later I would find out that he'd always choose the ""juiciest"" one to be butchered. And then we'd eat its flesh during Christmas dinners and other holidays. None of my family bothered to tell me where the meat came from.)

There are countless more examples. As a kid I saw animals frantically pacing back and forth in tiny zoo enclosures, watched lobsters get chucked into boiling pots of water, etc. I've always found it absolutely horrendous, yet I still didn't go vegan until I was 17. Perhaps most children are vegans at heart, but succumb to the pressure of conforming to social norms as they grow older. Especially being told the ""happy cows"" spiel and all that.

  However, I've now learned that in addition, some of our food and beverages may also have aborted fetuses from babies, examples of vegan foods and drinks include Pepsi and its other drinks, gums, and coffee creamers. 

  As Vegans, I would like to know is it ok to eat these products, or should we boycott them? Is this cannibalism or can we eat this? This does sound creepy but, in my personal opinion, aborted fetuses aren't sentient yet and aren't really causing harm to anyone, but they could be unhealthy and addictive.

Like, sometimes it seems as though people share images of NH animal abuse with a generalized statement just sort of post those images without any real activism or intent, and its just to share here among other vegans, and of course the picture just gets upvotes, but no serious discussion is ever happens. It just makes me wonder: would this happen if it were a human in that picture? Are we really separating ourselves from speciesism if we're treating pictures depicting NH animal abuse in a different light than we are picture of human abuse? 

I just wonder if people think about what they are sharing and why, and what they hope to accomplish by sharing it, and if that sentiment would be deemed ""appropriate"" if it were the images of humans.

The large space they ‘seemingly’ have (the ones outside anyway) caught me by surprise, it wasn’t like the ones in Vegan documentaries where animals are cramped inside tight spaces. But it’s all the same, whether so called ‘free-range’ or not. They still face the same cruel and heartless fate they don’t deserve.

Seeing the farm made me sad and powerless. I can’t ignore it, I know I’ll go back and pass by (even if it gave me serial killer vibes and the smell is not the best).

vegan,mfvf0n,BikingInBasel43,When was the first seed planted into your mind and how long did it take for you to go vegan?,"First of all, I wanna apologize for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker, but I want to share my story and hear about yours.

When I was young I thought vegans were crazy and I remember joking around with my brother about those protein-deficient and opinion-forcing plant eaters. I knew about the facts of the inhumane circumstances of lifestock farming and the outrageous consequences for our enviroment, but never reflected on them.

This all changed when I was 13 in early 2016, I was eating my favourite dish - spaghetti bolognese - when I scrolled through the trending YouTube videos and a video called ""Fleischkonsum zerstört unseren Planeten"" (meat consumption destroys our planet) by the german vegan ""influencer"" Luna Darko came into my sight, she would influence me pretty much in the following year on what person I want to be in the future, she seemed pretty smart and empathic, and often talked about self-love, self discovery, feminism etc. (sadly she deleted this video and distanced herself from the label 'vegan' last year). At this time I was very open and interested in enviromental topics, so I clicked on this video, I remember listening to what she had to say, she sounded very calm, polite and friendly, but you could also tell that this was a very important topic to her, she talked mostly about the eniviroment, but also about the connections to starvation, deseases and health issues and ethics, I remember when she said ""I know this might be the least convincing point for most people, which I think is very sad, cause we should care about this, but a pig has the same cognitive capability as a 3 year old human"", but for me it was one of the most convincing points, beside those about the complex social structures and emotions of cows and chickens. In the following days I gave frequent thoughts on this matter and decided that I want to be vegan myself someday - but not now. My father cooked much meat at this time and I don't wanted the social stigma of a male vegan.

For some reason I didn't even made a first step in the following years, but I knew that becoming vegan was the only right thing to do. I informed myself further on this topic and often argued in favor of veganism, but when a dairy or meat product was on my plate I forgot about it. I devoloped a hobby in cooking in 2017 and became the chef of what I eat, I reduced my flesh consumption, but still ate much of it.

This changed in March 2020 when my school stopped because of a global zoonotic pandemic and I decided to make the first step and got veggie. I knew that this wasn't enough and that I still wanted to be vegan someday, but I loved cheese, which of course I knew isn't a proper reason to eat it, but nevertheless I still ate it. My father, with whom I live with, was very supportive, beside often making stupid jokes and statements.

I became very interested in health topics, and started practising and eating more vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. I read many books and articles and nearly became obsessed with nutrition, so I discovered Niko Rittenau (german vegan nutritionist) and Dr. Michael Greger and read their books ""Vegan-Klischee ade"" (maybe the best book on nutrition, critical nutrients and debunking nutrition based stereotypes about veganism, sadly it's only available in german) and ""How not to die"", which had many shocking facts in it. So I decided to finally go vegan on my 1st anniversary of becoming vegetarian.

It's been one week and it's a miracle - There were 2/3 days in which I craved for cheese, but now, I don't even miss it anymore, despite our fridge being full of it. I am very happy that I'm finally vegan and regret that I haven't done it sooner.

But now I'm excited to hear about how your first seed was planted.",583593,1617040824,2021-03-30 02:00:24,2022302,28,1

The problem I find with most people is that they truly have no exposure to vegan meals or ideology. That’s why so many people think food is only a meal if it has meat. And why they think that vegans are hippies.

Supporting a gradual change will at very least introduce new options for meals, leading to less death, and at best will make the future change much easier.

Maybe most of you agree, and it’s only the most vocal and public activists that support this kind of thinking (if so, should we change that?), or maybe I’m wrong, let me know what you think!

vegan,mfqa8i,gplusplus314,Any musicians in here? Have you noticed any changes while on a vegan diet? I have!,"This post is a bit odd for this subreddit, but I think it’s sufficiently on-topic. First, my brief background is that I’ve been a musician for about 20 years and I’ve been *mostly* vegan for about 2 months. Lifestyle changes take work and time, so please forgive me for the “mostly” qualifier. I’m sure you all understand. 🙂

Anyhow, I immediately (within a day or two) started noticing measurable and subjective improvements in my health. My resting heart rate has lowered from 72 to 56 on average - holy smokes! My wedding ring is also looser. And that brings me to the subjective part. 

It’s fairly well known that a plant based diet lowers inflammation throughout the entire body as compared to a, for lack of a better term, “typical American diet.” But what I didn’t expect was that this would directly transfer to my ability to play my instrument. 

I’m a percussionist, which is basically a pompous high-brow term for drummer (badum-tschhh). When it comes to almost any instrument, a lot boils down to your technique, which determines your energy output and physical stress on soft tissue and joints. Well, in my case, my muscles have been able to fly through music and exercises as if I were 10 years younger, which was actually my peak physical condition. I get less tired, I’m less sore, and I recover much faster. My muscles aren’t are swollen after intense playing and I’m ready to go in less than half the recovery time. 

It’s insane. 

I wanted to share this because it has boosted my mood beyond anything I ever expected. I’m finally jazzed (😏) about drumming again after a 2 year hiatus due to various reasons. I didn’t think an unrelated lifestyle change would make such a huge impact, but it really did. 

Also related, my wife is also a musician (flutist) and she has reported a similar experience. 

I’ve been skeptical my whole life about vegan/plant-based diet/lifestyle. I really wish I tried this sooner. I just feel so much better overall. A boost toward getting back into my passion is seriously heart warming, too.",583520,1617026729,2021-03-29 22:05:29,2036397,8,1

Community members insulted my intelligence and told me to get educated... So I did. Thank Time magazine for their article, ""A Brief History of Veganism"".

""The first vegetarian society was formed in 1847 in England. Three years later, Rev. Sylvester Graham, the inventor of Graham crackers, co-founded the American Vegetarian Society. Graham was a Presbyterian minister and his followers, called Grahamites, obeyed his instructions for a virtuous life: vegetarianism, temperance, abstinence, and frequent bathing. In November 1944, a British woodworker named Donald Watson announced that because vegetarians ate dairy and eggs, he was going to create a new term called “vegan,” to describe people who did not. Tuberculosis had been found in 40% of Britain’s dairy cows the year before, and Watson used this to his advantage, claiming that it proved the vegan lifestyle protected people from tainted food.

vegan,mfjuy1,FrizzyMizzLizzy,I've been Vegan for Two months and I wish I could talk about it more,"I finally took the plunge in February this year (ironic since the whole 'FebruDAIRY' thing). I'm honestly so content with my decision, no more feeling guilty after meals and cringing at chicken carcasses every Sunday. I grew up being extremely fussy and pretty much only eating animal products, I would heave trying to eat vegetables. I knew that I wanted to be vegan, and I knew that I wanted to be healthy, so I ate more vegetables. It was shit at first, but I found ones I liked, and I got to the point where I could make nutritious and delicious vegan meals. I realised that I didn't need animals as a dietary crutch anymore. I know it hasn't been long but honestly, it's been so amazing for both my physical and mental health. I keep having moments where I think to myself 'fuck yeah I'm vegan now.' I come from a family of foodies and I was always the odd one out eating plain chicken and rice, and now I feel like a true foodie along with them. I'm more aligned with my morals, I feel like I am closer to being a true environmentalist now. 

But how do I talk about this to non-vegans? I only have one vegan friend, and since being switching I have noticed a very strange vibe. I haven't been met with all of the 'how do you get your protein?' nonsense just yet. I've had a bit of banter thrown at me for being awkward to buy for and having 'vegan rage' (I had a brief rant about UK tax-subsidies to a work colleague). I haven't been met with animosity, but there is this strange awkwardness.  It's almost as if people avoid the topic altogether. I genuinely thought that people would want to talk about it more, but despite a rise in popularity, I've realised that veganism is still strangely taboo. 

I don't want to be the one to sit at the dinner table talking about cow pus and chicken menstruate. I always wanted to be the 'lead by example' type, as that's how I became vegan, seeing others live happily and healthily doing so. I just didn't realise how profound this change would be for me, and I want to talk about it without feeling like I'm making things awkward. I dunno, I'm sure many of you would say that it's important to have awkward conversations for progress to happen, and I agree with you. I just don't know how to get the party started.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm a new vegan, loving life. But I'm scared to spread the good word because people still seem freaked out by veganism.",583417,1617001825,2021-03-29 15:10:25,2061301,14,1
vegan,mfjdz5,theredbobcat,What's the game-plan?,"I've been considering going vegan, and I eat less and less meat every day. I'm down to ~6 meals per week with meat (eggs/chicken). But my curiosity relates to the relationship between animals and money on the basis of Food and Clothing. 


Food: So when the world has stopped eating meat, what happens to all the pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, etc? Are they just slaughtered by the millions as factory-farm owners see they're no longer profitable? Is there at all talk of reintroducing cattle to the plains and just letting them roam free? Don't these species, after so many generations of domestication and purposeful breeding, now rely on captivity? Are there any plans to monetize the small-scale domestication of animals for purpose other than meat? What are they?


Clothing pertaining to sheep, alpaca, etc.:
Where do we draw the line on clothing? As far as I know, there's a lot of overlap between vegan and anti climate-change/pollution communities. Wool has special properties like maintaining heat retention properties even when wet. In an ever-trying climate with harsher extremes, we may need this more than ever. Do we keep using sheep for their wool? Alpacas? The replacements are often plastic-based and I don't know which is worse.


Similar arguments often arise concerning climate change—when we can make money at it is when it will be taken seriously, or something along those lines. Countless animals are displaced due to construction, pollution, and more. And there's currently no good way to make money out of helping these animals (Overgeneralization, and please correct me in DMs if that's wrong, but please hear me out). We primarily use nonprofits for that, right? Is there yet a way to make money helping these animals we can advertise? Something I've missed? You can keep your business ideas! I'll work for friggin' minimal wage to save the animals and the world!

Any sources, discussion, advice, comments, or anything is welcome below! Thanks for reading.

TLDR: How do we transition from an omnivorous society to vegan society while keeping animals around? Do we?",583410,1616999716,2021-03-29 14:35:16,2063410,7,1

vegan,mfhb60,AIM3RGAM3R,A question,"Hello, so I've been transitioning to a more plant-based lifestyle; I used to identify myself as vegan but I felt it was inappropriate and did not want to spread misinformation about the movement. This is due to me disagreeing with a fundamental core to veganism, namely the reduction of animal suffering by any practical means. I do not view animal exploitation as inherently evil, I believe it must depend on the circumstances. Almost all forms of animal agriculture today are cruel and I accept that.. leading me to adjust my lifestyle to avoid as much contribution to the industry as I can. However, my disagreements lie in the fact that science is leading to more and more ways where we can use animal products in sustainabe, economical, and less cruel ways.

I will use the popular example of lab-grown meat; we are moving past the need for FBS, and the methods are getting more and more productive. I read in an article, the projection is we can create 20,000 pounds of beef from a cell collection. The implications of this are monumental, we could get to the point where we only need a small donor herd per region, the small size of this population will imensly reduce greenhouse gasses and will be easier to maintain these animals and provide them with an optimum quality of life; the only downside is being a relatively painless biopsy.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose the crux of what I'm saying is that I think the exploitation of animal products can be done in an ethical way if certain parameters are met. 

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to my question; is this dissertation at odds with veganism?

 I greatly welcome criticism, comments, or questions.",583373,1616990695,2021-03-29 12:04:55,2072431,23,1
vegan,mffizb,LovelyMountain,Just because I’m vegan doesn’t mean I’m malnourished or have an eating disorder,I feel like a lot of non-vegan people are quick to assume that most vegans are malnourished and unhealthy. Based off of what I see on social media there is a total crisis with people telling others what they should and shouldn’t be eating. It’s very problematic and tone deaf. Most of the vegans i know are anything but being malnourished. Just because you’re plant based also doesn’t mean you don’t eat enough protein. Non-vegans love to tell vegans what they’re not eating enough of like they aren’t iron and vitamin deficient. It really frustrates me because I think most of it stems from stigma and other people own insecurities about what they eat. I figured I’d put this on the vegan Reddit because I don’t think I’m the only one who experiences these things.,583341,1616983995,2021-03-29 10:13:15,2079131,10,1
vegan,mfdtcu,Dantr1x,"Seaspiracy a film by a vegan, that sends a bad message","I was watching Seaspiracy and loving the exposure to the fishing industry and we need these in the media to open the eyes of those who are not aware of the impact animal farming of any species can have, but I have a major flaw I think needs to be addressed.

The movie does well to expose the financial interests of organisations such as Dolphin Safe and MSC is actually because they are funded by fishers. However, the film-maker is a long term vegan and made a vegan documentary before and even helped with Cowspiracy. Now that in itself isn't a problem, it is great, but it means I don't believe the ""aim of the journey"", so by him saying he didn't set off to make a documentary that shows the impact of eating fish seems untrue, maybe he did only want to make a film about plastic, but I would believe it more knowing he is a vegan filmmaker if he was honest that it was to show the impact of commercial fishing. I just feel anyone who looks into him, could think ""ah its more vegan propaganda by a vegan to guilt me into being vegan"". 

I like my messages of promoting veganism to be honest and fair otherwise it can be called out and this is in my opinion the issue with this film. What are your thoughts?

Also, I didn't like that it just told the audience to stop eating ""marine fish"" which doesn't include freshwater fish let alone other animals!",583316,1616977872,2021-03-29 08:31:12,2085254,13,1

vegan,mfdkzr,TrashMouthDiver,Freshwater fish tank?,"My hubby started watching documentaries about 4 yrs ago, pulled me into it, and we changed to a vegan diet maybe 3-4 yrs ago, him mainly for animals and health, me mainly for animals and the environment. 

It wasn't that big of an adjustment for me cuz I wasn't a huge meat eater anyway. Once I found good cheese I was set 😁 

He was always bereft w/o meat at a meal. FF to Nov last yr, he had a heart attack and now he's pretty much 100% produce, no more processed stuff at all. 

But lately we've been getting into stinks about ""making exceptions,"" I think b/c he feels like he's given up more than I. Ex: he started buying honey once the jar we had ran out (like 2 yrs old lol). I told him how it's not vegan, try agave, ""it's not the same! I'm using honey in my teas and that's THAT!""

He's always had fish tanks, but not for the last 10 yrs cuz we didn't have space. So 3-4 yrs ago we started thinking about it again (before we went vegan), made room for a nice aquarium, bought a cheap stand, spent MONTHS refinishing and fixing it, shopped for fish... Then other prioritie$ took over and we stopped for a while.

Now he's talking about it again, maybe a turtle (!), I'm telling him it's really not humane, etc, but ""I've always had fish, I love fish, what do we do with the tank now, blah blah blah."" Idk anymore, I don't want to fight anymore but we already have 2 dogs (stray/shelter) and a snake that I've had for maybe 20 yrs (he was a rescue and I won't have a pet snake again, but I don't trust someone else to adopt him)... but I can't argue that we won't have time b/c this is HIS thing, I have no idea about fish care.

How do I convince him pet fish aren't vegan? Are they less or moreso than dogs? We've been married 14 yrs and this isn't gonna make for a divorce or anything but it will take up a BIG part of our living room, a good chunk of $, and a long-term commitment. I'm also worried about what I see as a slippery slope of exceptions. Grrrrr",583310,1616977063,2021-03-29 08:17:43,2086063,5,1

5. Coconut

6. Cashew

7. Pea

Neutral:

vegan,mf0k3d,panveduci,My journey being vegan and my thoughts about it,"Hey guys!  I want to share how my lifestyle changed going vegan and how it gave me a new perspective about what we're eating and the overall picture with the current food chain. 

I also want to know what you're going to think about my perspective since I have in some ways different views for which I will get maybe downvoted but just hear me out. 

When I started college I started living on my own which meant that I had to cook for myself which I never did before moving out. I wanted to start experimenting a little with what I eat and my friend told me he was a Netflix documentary The Game Changers which I decided to give a try and try to avoid animal and dairy products on my plate. It started slowly but I stopped buying meat, then slowly getting rid of eggs, cheese, switched to plant-based milk. 

With this change, my teenage acne is 98% gone which was bad when I was in high school. Energy levels really boosted, I don't feel heavy when I finish my meal even if I fill myself completely, discovered so many ways of cooking and recipes.

After seeing this change I was reading more about how animal agriculture works and it was such an eye-opener how messed up the whole industry works and how I was uneducated about where does the food come from, what does it contain, how much nutrition it has, what's good and what's not, how many animals are killed. 

Coming from an Eastern Europe where meat is basically on a plate every second day it was quite a change, my family is still in confusion why the 'drastic' change but I won't be coming back to the eating habits because with the information I gained. 

Living in ignorance or unawareness about how my actions impact animals, the planet was, on one hand, blissful, because let's face it, everybody loves cheese, meat but it's not right at the expense of others, not in this era when we have so many substitutes and options to choose from and with the climate crisis.

But here's my second thought about it: if the animal industry and dairy industry operated in a more sustainable, moral way, I would support it. 

I grow up in a village my grandma had her own chickens whose eggs were incomparable with the ones available in supermarkets.  We also got a homemade cheese from one of her friends who got their own cows.

My belief is that if dairy, animal products were consumed once a month or just on special occasions and didn't take it for granted, we could reduce the suffering, global warming in a great way.

Right now in college, I am fully vegan, I read carefully what's on the label of the products I buy making sure no animal ingredients are in them.

However, when I come home for a few weeks I have to cheat because I am not the one cooking and my family always puts some milk, dairy into the food but I won't touch any meat they prepare. I can see that I made some positive impact on my family and friends as well, they started eating oats in the morning, tofu, soya chunks but they are not willing to transform their eating habits completely.

If you read this all the way through, let me know your thoughts, please!",583097,1616934561,2021-03-28 20:29:21,2128565,9,1

Also a lot of people, myself included tend to avoid these documentaries because of how raw and sad they are. I am an HSP/Empath and I cannot bare to witness this stuff but I told myself to just do it for the cause. The pain I experienced watching these documentaries is absolutely fuck all to what these breath taking beings experience.

I cried my eyes out several times. The section where they filmed in Denmark, I was inconsolable. But the information in this documentary was something we should all be aware of because it is staggering. Maybe if there’s a way for someone to summarise all the facts of the documentary without having to witness the pain and torture of these beings and make a post about it I think that might be a great idea.

vegan,mexsyg,Mona_Dylan,Anyone else getting extremely annoyed by Tiktok?,"As someone who has been deeply involved in veganism, although primarily for animal welfare, but morenow for environmental sustainability and humanitarian reason, I think it is workt acknowledging how biased tiktok is against vegans. Now not to say that veganism as an ideology is not worth criticism, but I keep getting videos recommended popping up in my FY page that play semantic games about veganism. Imagine if I said for example, ""everyone should donate to charity"" one would naturally assume that I am not including homeless and low income people. To assume or argue that this was the implication would clearly be a disingenuous assumption. But these are the same equivalence made about veganism on tiktok.

People are constantly implying that veganism is somehow colonialism. Trying to argue from a perspective of race that vegans are trying to use Imperialist ideologies to domineer oppressed cultures. Which I know that getting sustainable food is important and trying to buy food which was acquired using laborers who aren't abused financially is of course important to vegans. Most of us are deeply concerned not only about animal rights, but about human rights as well. Veganism as an ideology is altruistic in its essence. It really boggles me how people can argue that all we eat are quinoa and avocados, something that is very clearly exaggerated to seem as though we enjoy exploiting those in developing nations and their labour, but then ignore how their diet does the same. Most of the crops imported to and grown in the western world are used for the sake of the animal agricultural industry. This exploits the labour of the workers. Carnists use these arguments as if they themselves don't also consume the same products we do.

What angers me even more is they argue for example, that veganism is somehow racist to indigenous people and then ignore the destruction of the Amazon for animal agriculture, which is home to hundreds of indigenous tribes. Or how about the fishing industry which has fought tooth and nail, especially in Canada against the fishing rights of indigenous people, which in turn causes food insecurity? Not a peep. But they use their politics to try and instill an ideology that is based in false equivalencies. 

Wanna talk about discriminating towards people of low income? How about chicken farmers in the states who live at or below the poverty line because of industry abuses? Or maybe we should see low income communities like those in North Carolina who are predominantly Black, Native American and Latinos who live near CAFOs and are dying of diseases such as cancer caused by pollution from animal waste? Or how about the fact that the last 10 global pandemics have been caused by the animal food industry, which have disproportionate health outcomes for the people in the most empoverished communities? Or how about the fact that most of the world's lowest paying jobs are those of fast food workers? How about the fact that the animal agricultural industry is one one the highest sources of green house gas emissions in global warming which will harm the world most vulnerable communities as the global temperatures continue to rise? Anyone wanna mention any of that? Yet somehow veganism is exploitative and classist?

The fact alone that we have enough food on the planet to end world hunger, yet most of the world's crops go are used to feed livestock which go to feed the world richest nations is horrifying. This is somehow a reality we're all accustomed to and have collectively decided is ok. Somehow veganism is the problem.

Now as I mentioned earlier, problems in vegan food sourcing like any other diet are worth dicussing. Like migrant workers yielding crops at what is essentially slave labour is horrifying. But this is not an issue caused by veganism, nor will it be solved by attacking veganism. If there were no vegans, this would still be an issue as news flash, carnists also eat vegetables.

I am sick of the semantic games and I am sick of the accusations. Why are these issues only raised when the subject of veganism is brought up... I don't see these carnists advocating against exploitation until it suits their biases. Can we all agree that it is getting ridiculous?

 ...

Disclaimer: I'm not vegan btw so I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion.


Would you eat something that died of age, or a non transmittable disease, or an accident not intentionally caused. Something that experienced no intentional suffering or cruelty in it's life.

Here's an example. 
You get a pet chicken and you name her cluckerina
Every day you feed her, help her, play with her, love her
You love her and she loves you
Eventually after 10 years of having a great life, cluckerina dies peacefully

Would it be ethical to eat her. She wasn't suffering in life.

Easier:
- not craving meat and dairy
- finding vegan restaurants in my area
- finding vegan meat and dairy substitutes 

Honestly, when I tried to adopt plant based diet couple years ago I failed due to cravings. But something's changed when I went for veganism instead, and cravings are no longer a problem. 

Harder
- finding sustainably packaged vegan substitutes for meat and dairy
- finding sustainably packaged vegan cosmetics

TBH I thought that vegans in general, and vegan-targeting companies care more about the environment but they choose plastic almost all the time. I know enough about the reality of recykling to avoid plastic packages at all costs, so it means I am almost never eating products that are not fruits, vegatables, legumes and grains.",583034,1616915804,2021-03-28 15:16:44,2147322,19,1

vegan,met16z,goji-berries,Shameless plug for vegan meal kit services + Ideas for trying new recipes?,"I just wanted to put this out there for anyone who might be struggling to find new vegan recipes or healthier recipes or whatever - meal kits are a GREAT option. 

Basically the idea behind meal kits is you get the ingredients for a certain number of meals (on average three) per week sent to you with a recipe card and you make them (they're marketed towards people who don't have much time to grocery shop and cook or who eat a lot of fast food). I personally keep the recipe cards in a binder so that I can make the ones I liked again. There are companies that offer vegan options and also one company (Purple Carrot) that is entirely vegan. 

The only downside is price tag - $7-10 per portion is quite a bit, so it's definitely a luxury for me and I don't order every week. 

Has anyone else tried these, or have similar ways to try out new vegan dishes that don't involve a separate trip to the grocery store and tons of leftover ingredients? I would love to do it more, but it's time consuming, and spending $10 for a particular spice that I'm never going to use for anything else again is a bit steep.",582987,1616900149,2021-03-28 10:55:49,2162977,6,1

I’m sure this post will get deleted maybe they’ll ban me from the sub or maybe a bunch of people will just reply with more hate and dislikes. This makes me feel excluded from a community I spent so long unsure if I should join. It’s like my suspicions were being confirmed. 

I agree with you guys! And I just had one question!! I didn’t even have an opinion on the question it was straight up just a question. some had an issue that everyone asks it but that doesn’t mean it’s invalid. A lot of people ask “if humans came from monkeys why are their still monkeys” if every scientist just disliked their question the world wouldn’t get any more knowledgeable on the subject. So many people were unwilling to answer it and just hated me. If you can’t even debate someone on your own side how can you debate someone against you.

vegan,mese7o,im_sensitive_,My mom wants me to eat “Amish” eggs and butter in return of her stopping eating all meat and following the same diet as me.,"So, today I tried watching a documentary called “seaspiracy” with my mom and she got so mad claiming that she already knows all of that and didn’t even finish watching. By the end we got into a fight. Just now she called me and said that she will give up seafood and other meat and will only eat whatever I eat if I include butter and eggs into my diet. I said no, obviously. Then she said we will get it from Amish people who do it “sustainably”. I told her that I won’t believe that it’s sustainable until I see it with my own two eyes. She agree and told me she will take me to their farm. Is she bluffing? Is this a good deal? I don’t like the idea of it because I just really don’t want to consume the milk of a cow... it’s just so wrong to me now. Same goes for eggs. I really don’t feel comfortable with it, but she is claiming that she will give up all meat....I am really not sure how to feel about this.",582979,1616897829,2021-03-28 10:17:09,2165297,13,1

vegan,mer4sp,tiff40278,Ewww!,Recently vegan (last year or so) and was watching a documentary about Victorian farming and just ewww! All my family and friends are still meat eaters and it just makes me nauseous to think about now! How did I ever eat that stuff ! Sometimes I just go through life now without a second thought about it then seeing farming and butchering - ummmm no! As a bonus my 17 year old is embracing the vegan-ness- so one small step at a time :-),582962,1616893326,2021-03-28 09:02:06,2169800,0,1
vegan,meqg7l,SundaySalmon,I've been Vegan for one month now and things are going well.,"The biggest struggle is figuring out how to vary my meals. I eat oatmeal and a banana every morning, spinach and black bean wrap for lunch. And either tofu/rice/brocoli or quinoa/brocoli for dinner. Sometimes pasta. I tried tempeh and wasn't a huge fan, but I really need to figure out some more meals to fit in. Any suggestions? I'm open to try new things!

Another concern of mine is the consumption of soy. I'm male, and although the estrogen thing seems to be nonsense, I have heard that high levels of soy could lead to infertility, and since I'd like to have kids someday, I dont want to overdo it until I can do more research. But dang... I'd eat tofu everyday otherwise. 

I haven't told anyone really yet. My mom knows and my brother knows now, but I just don't like attention and I'm scared of people making comments to me... and I just don't want to deal with it quite yet. 

Shoes were a unexpected curveball. I really needed new shoes and my mom surprised me by getting me some... which was nice of her but I had to be sure they were vegan. Information was hard to find, but I ended up calling sketchers customer service and gave them the item number. They confirmed that the shoes are vegan (yay!). I need skate shoes as well, so hopefully I can find some vegan skate brands soon. 

I watched dominion after becoming vegan and it just solidified my choice. I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of it without crying horribly. I can't imagine anyone can watch this and think ""yeah this is ok. I'll just keep getting animal products"" but I know some do. I still haven't finished it, but I can only take it bit by bit. The thought of eating animal products just makes me sick at this point. 

I'll keep going. No turning back.",582950,1616891051,2021-03-28 08:24:11,2172075,29,1

vegan,men36f,TheDemonLady,The sneaky vegan,"Hear me out.

My best friend is the best vegan I have ever met. She is a vegan because that is what she morally believes is right, but she has never once tried to make me eat vegan even when I'm with her. I've had friends before that were vegans and whenever we're together they expect me to eat vegan and I do not give them a hard time about that because I understand that is their moral stance. When we're making pancakes together she makes hers vegan and she's like oh I almost forgot you're not vegan and you prefer it with eggs and she makes mine with eggs.

So I'm not kidding the most respectful vegan I have ever met. We have been friends for 5 years. That being said she has shown me some really yummy vegan food companies that have microwave meals that are delicious that I just actually like and when I'm with her sometimes I choose to eat vegan with her and she's shown me some really good recipes.

She's also British so her family has forced me to love tea and we were talking about tea and she's like well I make it this way with almond milk, but of course you'll probably be using regular milk so just use this much to make it just the way you like it at my house. And I was like oh my gosh you know what I think the tea would probably taste really good with almond milk instead of my dairy milk. I should definitely use almond milk, because it's also really good in and I listed a few other recipes that I use it in although I don't like drinking almond milk or using it in cereal.

Then suddenly I realized, and I called her on it, I'm like you are sneakily making me vegan! You are playing the long game and I respect that! You respect the fact that I'm not vegan so much that I feel the need to respect the fact that you're vegan more than I normally would and you're showing me how yummy it can be. How dare you, I'm going to go drink my vegan tea with my vegan pancakes",582889,1616880369,2021-03-28 05:26:09,2182757,5,1
vegan,mem6w4,F1RST-1MPR35510N,Joining team Vegan (again),"Went vegan a few years back after about 2 years I started making exceptions at family events, slid back into vegetarian status, and then omnivore.

Wanted to get back into veganism, started 30 day boot camp last week. (Dominion is fucking brutal to watch). Threw out more products that aren't vegan (TJ's Omega's pills, looking at you. Deva Omega's  on route).

&amp;#x200B;

Random questions : are there any fast food vegan breakfasts (that aren't oatmeal or piles of hash browns) that are easily available? 

Any tips or advice would be great. Thanks",582885,1616877643,2021-03-28 04:40:43,2185483,9,1
vegan,mem5de,Kissadog,Too much animal cruelty everywhere. How do you cope?,"And it's really bad in my country, i just read an article on the pig farm in my area, too much pig abuse, people don't give a shit. Nothing is done about it. The pig industry is very unregulated in my country, it's the worst one, because only a minority here eats pigs (christians), they do eat a lot of pigs tho.


It's just hard to cope with animal cruelty sometimes, i want to vent, i want to hear how you guys deal with all the animal cruelty in the world, it's really sad.


I mean all the animal abuse outside of exploitation is way too much already, and where i live it's normal for youngsters and kids to abuse animals for fun, idk why that is, it's fucked, and no one seems to care

There’s a comfort food restaurant called mattie’s foods. They are a small business and 100% VEGAN!!!!

They have classic kansas city style food and other delicious stuff made vegan and it’s amazing. I wanted to get the message out about this place because there’s not many options at all here and I want to potentially help their business. It is a bit pricey but to me it’s completely worth it.

Over the last year I have lost a lot of weight and don’t seem to be putting any on even after going to sleep usually on a full stomach.
I decided to track what I was eating with Cronometer only recently and noticed that after dinner I’m only ending up around 1600 calories. 
Can anyone give advice on what I can do to up this so I gain weight but in a healthy way? 
Also what should my macros be looking like? 
My carbs are around 230g, is this too much or too little? 
So much questions but just looking for some advice on this as I would like to stay vegan for sure.
