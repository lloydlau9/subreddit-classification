keto,mvvh65,freddyt55555,Allulose is amazing!,"Guys, I'm not kidding. It's like a fucking natural miracle drug.

About a month ago, I posted about how allulose is like [Ex-Lax](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mbiksm/allulose_better_than_exlax/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I stopped using it for a while, but I recently found out that not only does it not spike your blood glucose, it can actually make your blood glucose [go down](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/mtic7m/eating_fruits_with_allulose/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I'm not the only one who's experienced [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/mv9djm/allulose_what_the_heck_is_going_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

I found out that the Ex-Lax effect is basically the allulose blocking the metabolism of certain carbohydrates. Here's an excerpt from the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psicose):

&gt;Allulose is a weak inhibitor of the enzymes α-glucosidase, α-amylase, maltase, and sucrase.\[2\] Because of this, it can inhibit the metabolism of starch and disaccharides into monosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tract.\[2\] Additionally, allulose inhibits the absorption of glucose via transporters in the intestines.\[2\] For these reasons, allulose has potential antihyperglycemic effects, and has been found to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia in humans.\[2\]\[9\]

No only does it block metabolism of carbs, it can lower cholesterol (if you care about such trivialities, that is):

&gt;Through modulation of lipogenic enzymes in the liver, allulose may also have antihyperlipidemic effects.\[2\]\[9\]

The 2nd link above cites a bunch of studies of the antihyperglycemic effects of allulose, but there's another study that shows that it can protect the [beta cells](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230644405_Rare_sugar_D-psicose_protects_pancreas_b-islets_and_thus_improves_insulin_resistance_in_OLETF_rats) in the pancreas as well.",2372343,1619058942,2021-04-22 10:35:42,4702,0,1
keto,mvuulx,beenroasted,Here we go again.,"I formerly weighed 435 lbs and I lost 125 eating ketogenically for two years. I felt great, I was motivated in all aspects of life, but I did it for the wrong reasons. I did it because I hated myself. The day I started keto I remember the conversation I had with myself. I was severely depressed, I was ready to take drastic action in the worst way. I decided to try one last thing I would cut out everything I thought I loved - friends, Taco Bell, video games. I thought the only way to get myself to move forward was to torture myself. And I did it for two years. The results were amazing and I felt the best I ever felt but I also had the lingering sense of despair and self loathing. I gained all the weight back over the next two years and then some. I gave up on myself, I didn’t see the value of me being around. I was living in filth, I smelt bad, my hair was stupid long. I was a total embarrassment only bringing myself together to go work and even then minimal effort. 

I’m back. Two weeks ago I decided to go back to keto for me. Because I want better, because I want to be around. I want to not be embarrassed of myself when I walk into a room, or down a street or looking in the mirror. I want to not worry about having a heart attack and dying leaving behind loved ones. Some of the people I hold dearest to my heart try to convince me to get the surgery. But I already learned the hard way that it isn’t just the weight and that it was the mentality I’ve lived with for the last 15 years. I need to break that mentality and the only way for me to do it is to work through it with the right mindset. 

I’m starting at what I would guess is 475 lbs. I know I already lost weight but I don’t have a scale that can weigh me. I don’t know if anyone cares or if anyone can relate to this but I needed to get this off of my chest. Thanks everyone. Good luck out there.",2372316,1619056688,2021-04-22 09:58:08,6956,0,1

I’m a little over one month in. My doctor told me I didn’t really need to take keto that seriously (he just wanted me to lay off carbs) but, I have taken it seriously. 

I’ve lost a little over 10lbs and this was with absolutely minimal effort for working out. Like I’m talking I only took a few walks a day, if that. I just started a new job when I started keto and have a few projects launching soon so I’ve just been busy. I don’t do scales. But I was just curious and sure enough!!! That number dropped!!! I’m loose fitted in a lot of my tops and can fit into old jeans I had been holding onto.

Now that things are settling I can’t wait to see progress with working out. 

PCOS updates: With just one month down, I did get my period - on my own! 

Migraines: I have had maybe one migraine since starting keto. I used to get sooo many every WEEK, and they were painful and mimicked stroke symptoms. 

I’ve learned so much on here just lurking and I’m forever grateful. I don’t miss anything. I’ve found amazing substitutes for almost everything I crave and I honestly want to cry over the fact that I got my period 😂

keto,mvpksb,redcairo,Further fat loss possible on keto? (in menopause) Can you actually stall at 350#??,"What is truly possible with keto, are there limits?

Backstory: back in 2007, I lost 170# on keto, and then a birth-defect heart-valve failure nearly killed me. Many years later (some years bedridden on hospice dying, so full-body atrophy, low-oxygen, and major weight gain), I got surgery to fix that, eventually learned to walk again (that look like a year on my own with it), and so on. It's been a few years since, and I am still not strong like I'd like to be though I'm improving. I dropped from mid-500s at surgery to around 350 (sometimes lower, I add/remove about 25-30# for water with keto, and the diuretics I must take to compensate for the heart valve still creating some edema daily) (managing mineral balance with both keto and diuretics is seriously a bitch).

I've turned my whole living room into a home gym. When keto, I eat mostly meat, most the veggies I eat are peppers/alliums or 'in context' of the meat (e.g. chili con carne). I've dropped cheese quantity radically to reduce both calories and possible inflammation. 

I am so damn stalled. If I eat carbs I gain water; if I eat ketogenically (which I have done for many years so am very fluent with it by now of course) I lose that water. I don't really gain weight (because I am not off keto long enough, mostly). I don't really lose weight (it drops the water, then just... doesn't fuckin move! It's driving me crazy).

I have been going back and forth, about 8 weeks of keto and then about 1-2 weeks of carbs, or sometimes a fast, because it USED to be, that sometimes if weight wasn't coming off, ""changing things up"" -- fasting, or actually adding carbs briefly -- would seem to resolve that. That doesn't seem to be working anymore. I don't think it's a low thyroid issue, although I don't trust doctors about this anyway it's such a nightmare watching my friends try to get decent help with that, and I have no money for a doc right now anyway. Actually I have vastly more energy than I used to -- greatly thanks to supplements (thyroid support herbs, tiny bit DHEA, 7-keto metabolites, pregnenolone, CoQ10, and a variety of other things, I'm a supplement freak and because of the diuretics I lose some of everything all the time so I try to compensate). 

So I don't feel like it's just, ""Hey you're in menopause, you probably are hypothyroid or something, give up."" I weight 350 fuckin pounds I don't want to give up! I have worked so hard to get over 200# down, hell even to learn to walk again, I do NOT want to give up. But just doing the same thing to no effect at all is really screwing with my psychology.

Eating keto, even with what I think should be reasonably low calories: no weight loss. I do IF at 20/4, keto, no weight loss. I fast for 3 days, 7 days, 10 days -- yes there IS weight loss during the fast (sometimes as much as 1/2# per day max) but the instant I resume eating (lowcarb) it returns -- so, clearly it was only water weight. How is this even possible? How could I be so large, and have done so well at losing so much weight already, and yet not lose even when both calories and carbs seem like they ought to do it, especially at my still-high weight? Age 55, female, menopause (yes I know that's not ideal), 5'6"".

I have not yet seriously started working out. I would like to. I have... everything. I spent basically all my money on this stuff hoping to save myself. Squat cage, bench, t-bar, kettlebells, barbell, dumbbells, cables, straps... I have no idea what the hell I am doing and I do not currently have the option of hiring someone to train me (a/ unexpected poverty onset, hopefully temporary, and b/ tiny nowhere-town in nowhere-usa). I have begun walking in the mornings, I was doing that until winter, the weather only just got sane for it to start up again. So whatever the reason for my stupid stall, it can't be that I'm working out too hard.

So after all that intro, I have two questions for this awesome group:

1. Do you have any suggestions for what kind of exercise might be best to start with for someone who is not strong (bodyweight ground exercises with little muscle and high weight, esp. as a woman, are not too workable; but I can do 'a little' with most of everything I have. Just not sure if I should be working on the arnold press or t-bar squats or 2-handed kettlebell or what...
2. Do you have any suggestions, and bear in mind I am limited to walmart food here (sigh), and that doesn't involve long fasts (which I LOVE doing, but my body tells me she would prefer I not get carried away with that, as I've a long history of medical-anorexia and severe malnourishment even while huge as a result), that someone has reason to think might work to force me out of what seems an endless stall? (Like 1 year, though I have been ""In and out"" of keto all during that, my weight always returns to center at 350 like it's a set-point)?
3. The only thing I will note is that if I do not eat at least 90g of protein a day I am less functional. Many years of trial went into knowing this about myself. Everything else can vary but that's got to be a minimum.

Many thanks in advance.",2372086,1619039519,2021-04-22 05:11:59,24125,8,1
keto,mvpgum,johninbigd,Weird blood glucose today,"I haven't eaten anything since around 8:30-9 last night. I checked my blood glucose this morning around 10am. It's normally around anywhere from 105-115 then, but it was 130 according to the unreliable Keto-Mojo. I tested it again a few minutes later and it said it was 120. 

I went to the pharmacy and picked up a real dedicated blood glucose monitor kit. At 2:00pm I was at 105. So, still high and kinda weird. I just checked it again, one hour later, and it's at 112! How in the hell is that possible? This feels super weird to me. 

The only carbs I've had today is a little heavy whipping cream in my coffee earlier this morning. I've probably had a total of 1-2 Tbps and that was hours ago.

I don't trust the Keto Mojo tester, so I guess I don't have a good baseline of previous tests. Using that meter, I was at 98 an hour ago. I would expect to be down to around 95 or less by now, but that's using the Keto Mojo meter, not the more-accurate meter I just bought.

keto,mvjlyh,audreysmother,I don’t think I’m in Ketosis,"Hi there, I (26 F) have been doing keto for 10 days now and I’m UK based. My SW was 63kg, current weight 61.9kg and my goal weight 55kg. I’m 5’3. 

I am not sure if I’m being lazy in my approach, I am also trying to make it a life style change so it’s not too hard. I am getting married in July so this is my date to aim for.

I try to eat no more than 1400 cals a day, I do personal training (only started on 12th along with Keto due to government restrictions) once or twice a week; otherwise I am VERY sedentary. I am also doing IF 16:8 between 12-8pm

I am eating a lot of salads - meat/fish with salad leaves and avocado. 
My typical day is lunch between 12-1pm, a salad - meat / fish (plain) with salad.
- or unsmoked back bacon with egg and avocado.
Dinner:
- meat - sometimes cooked in sauces. So tomato based sauces with herbs and spices with broccoli and green beans.

I drink green tea and do have a Coke Zero. I am addicted to Coke Zero. I have just started having the odd coconut milk latte.

The only symptoms I have experienced is that day 2 evening I had the first migraine of my life, I was in agony. But I was wondering if that’s also because I had a hot bath after PT. The next day I was a bit iffy but fine. I am also a lot thirstier than normal and as a result weeing a lot. No issues with bowels.

Other than that, I think about nice breads and Chinese food but not cravings per se. I also am not that hungry and don’t feel that starving feeling much. 

When I’m reading packets I do try to look out for carbs but I’m not sure if there’s hidden ones in the foods I’m eating?

I also am drinking. Life has just got back to normal so Friday and Saturday I had a drink or two (vodka soda). I will continue to do this for the next few weeks because lockdown has ruined so many things.

Thanks for any help.

P.s. gross but I feel like my breath is always a bit dodgy after I’ve eaten or drunk so can’t tell.",2371827,1619022997,2021-04-22 00:36:37,40647,22,1

If so, what happened, and did you stop keto forever, or change something and things got better?

Female 49
Current weight 210
Starting weight about 218
Height 5’4”
I have tracked literally everything everyday
I do not exercise although I am a busy mom
I didn’t have too much keto flu
I am sleeping great!

I have reduced my deficit to 30% and feel fine at 1192 calories or less. I really didn’t lose much in the beginning like most people did, and quite honestly I haven’t lost much in total. I have only had 1 meal that I completely messed up at a restaurant ( I should have planned better )

I’ve had plenty of days that weight goes up and down, I get and accept that. The last 2 days I have gone .5lb each day. It is frustrating and discouraging!
I am not deterred at all though I just wish the scale was showing more loss. 

Are my calories too low?
Is 30% deficit hindering me?

My Macros are set at 
Calories 1192
Protein 86
Fat 85
Carbs 20

Everything single day my carbs are below 20 often much lower.

This goal weight is still considered Overweight for my height. And to be in the normal range I need to be between 110-150 lbs (50-63kgs). 

Through keto, I'm proud of my accomplishments having lost about 60+ lbs (29kgs) in 7.5 months.

* Cheese is one of the main sources that I am relying on (I am staying away from heavily processed cheese like american etc). But is there a concern if its my main source of fat?

* Is peanut butter keto friendly? (I have seen mixed opinions on that)

* I have Nature’s Bounty calcium magnesium zinc supplement since I have read that you tend to run low on electrolytes. Would you recommend such supplements for beginners?

I stopped working out and picked up a few unhealthy habits which ultimately have caused me to gain roughly 8KG of fat. I don't really have a gut, but my face has blown up big-time. (Seriously, I'll post pictures if anyone is interested. Why does so much of it go straight to my head?)


So about a week ago I decided to explore dietery options. I was already familiar with keto because of its popularity. The thought of a high protein diet appealed to me because my body still has some semblance of muscle that I want to hold onto. So I made the choice. 

Fast forward to today and it's been 6 days since I dived in head first. I decided to lower my carb intake gradually and started out with 100g of carbs on the first day. From there on out I did 80 grams on the second, third and fourth and 50 on the fifth and sixth. 

Misc info:

I was 114kg going in and have lost about 3kg of water weight since. I am about 200cm tall. I am now consuming anywhere between 2000-2500 calories. My daily intake was 3500-4200 prior to starting keto.



Questions:

1.. The second and third day were very difficult. I am a little low on energy but have been fine since. I've read a lot about keto flue. Does this mean the worst is yet to come?

2. I drink diet coke? I long for sugar, but obviously don't want to waste my carb intake.


3. Can I realistically lose 10kg in 10 weeks if I consume less than 50 grams of carbs and consume somewhere between 2000-2500 calories while only doing 20 mins of light excersise bi-daily?

I started keto on 9 Jan after gaining some very significant quarantine weight. Boredom plus the inability to do my normal exercise routine hit me hard and I ballooned up. I have done keto with success before so I can back and came back hard.

For 100 days I weighted and tracked everything I ate. Of course I had a few days where I overshot my macros but overall I was consistently on my goals. I completely stopped eating keto desserts and bread substitutes which were a big trigger from me in the past.

I upped my exercise, starting with a couch to 5k. When I started I was struggling to run for 2 minutes. This week I ran over 7 miles in one go! I plan on running a half ironman this summer.

I'm down over 7 inches on my waist and you can see muscles on my back instead of rolls now!

Currently I’ve been getting 3500-4000 sodium, about 2800 potassium and 600-800 magnesium (supplementing 300 with Calm powder, the rest is food). I drink almost 3 liters of water a day. I’m eating lots of salads and what seems to me to be very healthily. Avacados, almonds, pickles, seeds, chicken, beef, nutritional yeast, wheatgrass, fish oil, multi vitamin...
I have also been tracking all the reactions my body has, to guide my electrolyte targets. 
This is where I’m really struggling because, as recommended, I’m trying to keep my sodium up. But I seem to be having bad reactions to salt, that I’ve tested several times. Right after consuming it, I get twitching everywhere, sudden BMs, anxiety, and worse of all super irritable which is causing problems at home 😖. And this has even happened after just salting my food with less than 1/8th of a teaspoon! So one day I tried cutting sodium back to 3000mg and it felt like I got keto flu again, I felt terrible (light headed, extreme fatigue). 
I haven’t read of anyone else having this problem, could it be that too much salt is causing me to have low potassium? Do I have too much magnesium? I am also struggling to get a full nights sleep, I wake up after about 5 hours having to manage electrolytes, particularly more mag (to feel drowsy) and potassium (to soothe anxiety). I don’t want to give up but I am feeling defeated 😞. Has anyone had a similar experience?",2370905,1618951922,2021-04-21 04:52:02,111722,31,1
keto,muzu1r,chelskeewelskee,340s to 170s,"Can't believe it's been over a year since I've posted on the ol' reddit lol where does the time go? Thought I'd give an update: On my 3rd year of keto, down about 170 pounds and have been maintaining that loss for about a year. I do keto my own way; thus, creating sustainability.

I thought I'd compile a list of FAQs I get asked most often.

Q: Do you track macros?  
A: My goal everyday is 20 net carbs per day or less, I don't care about fat/protein (although I eat lots of protein).

Q: How many calories do you eat per day?  
A: I don't like to give out that number because calories are personal to everyone and based on your height/weight/activity/goals. I've always used Carb Manager to give me mine.

Q: Do you offer coaching?  
A: As much as I love both money and keto lmao, that just isn't for me. 

Q: Do you do egg fasts? Or any fasts?  
A: Nah dawg. Those are short-term solutions to a long-term problem. And call me crazy but I like to enjoy my food lol.

Q: Do you have loose skin?  
A: Everywhere! No current plans for removal mostly because I'm cheap and a wuss 🤣

Q: How did you get started with keto?  
A: I JUST STARTED! I researched the basics, went shopping and just fuckin started. I learned more as I went through trial and error. I immersed myself with knowledge and filled my social media feeds with inspiration from others on the same journey. 

Q: Did you exercise?  
A: I lost 160lbs my first 2 years with no exercise. My 3rd year I started walking and I very recently started jogging.

Q: Did you take ketone supplements?  
A: NO.

Q: Do you ever have cheat days?  
A: Yes bitch 🤣 I am not in ketosis every day of my life and I have ""off plan"" meals from time to time. I do nothing special afterwards, it's just business as usual my very next meal. No fasting, no ""get back into ketosis fast"" bullshit, just back-on-plan eating.

Q: How do you stay motivated?  
A: I want to live a happy, healthy life. Not a perfect one. I will always be a work in progress and I will always be seeking balance as this journey evolves from one phase to the next. We have LOTS to stay excited about 😁

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been doing keto since January and i'm almost 40 lbs down, but that's not even half.

I've also been really lazy, as in i've allowed myself to feast way too much. 

I'm really a serious emotional eater and that's why keto is so great since you can have meat and cheese. But i've never cheated once so far, and frankly, don't intend too (i do miss chocolate, though...)

Summer is coming and I really need to double down. Because it gets reaaaaally hot where i live, and because i realise i could have lost way more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say i should exercise but i hate it way too much...

I'll try to go back to 1500 (or less) calories per day, but i tried it in march and i just couldn't do it.

Seems like i'm going to have to, though

I know it's up to me in the end, but sometimes, and especially lately with lockdown and my professional situation, sometimes i'm just like...fuck it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, can I get some motivationg messages, that i can go back to when i'm weak?

Thanks in advance!",2370808,1618946095,2021-04-21 03:14:55,117549,11,1

keto,muu85f,ukuleleForYourSoul,"4th time attempting keto, electrolyte questions and problems - Please help!","I've attempted keto 4 times and every time I've had to quit because of a tingling in my extremities, brought on by electrolyte problems. I'm certain this gets asked A LOT in many different ways on this subreddit, but I cannot find answers whatsoever, and I've tried so many different approaches, so I'm going to try to keep this concise as possible. 

* How difficult is it to have too much sodium, potassium, magnesium on keto? Should I be worried about overdosing or does that only happen to people with bad kidneys? I'm worried about noticing some symptoms, upping my intake, and then having a seizure or paralysis from potassium toxicity (this might be hypochondria, but I'm still too concerned to attempt it).
* How much water is too much? I've had about 2L of water today with 5000mg salt, 1250mg potassium, 400mg magnesium (plus food). I'm peeing what appears to be beautiful crystal clear distilled water, which makes me think I'm drinking way too much.
* Are the electrolytes balanced relative to each other or does 'electrolyte imbalance' just mean ""deficiency or too much of"" a particular electrolyte? Do they need to fall into some ratio? Every source I've seen either gives a lower limit or a 'suggested acceptable range', nothing about balancing them with each other, or going over the limit and getting sick.
* Are muscle cramps caused by any particular electrolyte deficiency? I can tell *something* is up because I can produce a cramp by flexing my toes - when it gets really bad a cramp appears nearly instantly.
* Are pins and needles / tingling caused by any particular electrolyte deficiency? This is the symptom that worries me the most, and the one that has caused me to pull the plug every time. I've seen online it can be caused by any deficiency, but that magnesium is often the culprit. I've taken 400mg today, which is apparently the very upper limit, but have not taken tablets on previous days until this point. I've got this symptom now, but I'm not sure if it's because of the magnesium, so I'm worried about taking too much and causing a serious problem. If I've been deficient up until now, then would taking 600mg or even 800mg to 'top me up' be a good idea? I'm using magnesium citrate.

I'm on day six of my fourth attempt. Each time, although I'm drinking salted water, (lo salt, lite salt, table salt, you name it), and eating rather a lot of meat, I eventually get pins and needles / tingling in my extremities at night and have to stop - enough to keep me awake at night. 

I just don't get it - some of the folks here can drift into ketosis just fine whereas it seems I'm trying to balance 4 unruly electrolytes in the dark, because the only concrete information I can find is ""too much or too little of an electrolyte is bad"".

If it helps: I'm of a healthy BMI, and I run 3 times weekly. Thank you!",2370660,1618936073,2021-04-21 00:27:53,127571,22,1

keto,muoglw,colormarkers,Did you develop a strange taste? What could be the reason?,"Hey, there, ketoers!

If you don´t mind me asking, did you get any changes in how you taste food?


I´ve been more than 1 year on keto (whispering: with cheat meals every week) and it´s been always a good sign for me that sweet stuff taste veeery sweet, like I can eat a carrot and it tastes sweet, you know what I mean, right? This for me was always a sign that I´m keeping my sweets and carbs low. 


But recently I decided to go more strict on keto, try to go on without cheats and it´s like I´ve lost the taste. After 10 days with clean keto I started feeling very anxious (I´m definetely addicted to carbs) and decided to go for Chinese. Nothing crazy, not like noodles or anything, more like seafood with vegetables and... ok, dumplings. OK, so the weird thing is that I expected to have an explosion of flavour in my mouth with the dumplings but... nothing. SO WEIRD. 
So I took the shrimps and like meh, nothing. And same for the beef. No explosion of anything, it was like eating a paper sheet. It´s not the restaurant because I tried my usual eggs, sausauges and cucumber for breakfast the next day and usually it´s like super savory and fullfilling and... nothing. 


In order to check if it was that illness we all know, I took a piece of dark chocolate and it tasted so sweet I wanted to vomit. And I can smell my shower gel so that´s not it. I mean, the sweet flavour and smell are there but magnified. It´s like I can´t notice the savory flavours.

Im taking the usual keto supplements already prepared, with Mg, K, Na, vit D3, etc, the usual stuff. 


In summary: going more strict on keto, sweet flavours make me almost vomit and savory stuff taste like paperboard. Have you experienced this in your journey?? (It´s so annoying)",2370400,1618918965,2021-04-20 19:42:45,144679,10,1

F, 21, 5'5. 99g protein, 113g fat, 20g carbs. 1498 cals. 

I woke up today and I still have this pain. I talked to my neighbour (she is a registered nurse) and said it could be a muscular pain or I might be passing a kidney stone and advised me to drink lots &amp; lots of water. 
Tbh I don't think is muscular, it does not feel like it. This pain feels very deep inside, is dull and it comes in waves. It also spreads to my abdomen. Not sure about kidney stone either. 
I don't have any other symptoms. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. 

Is it possible that the transition into ketosis is putting my kidneys under 'stress'? Could it be electrolytes? 
Anybody been in a similar situation, what did you do? What worked for you? Thanks. 


P.S: I know that I should contact my doctor about this, don't lecture me on that, please. I will if it really doesn't go away/it gets worse. Just curious if anybody else experienced this.",2370340,1618915811,2021-04-20 18:50:11,147833,6,1

Hello, my name is Evan Davies. I am conducting a study into the effect of ketogenic diet on mood, stress and cognition as the subject of my Master’s thesis, at Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne (UK). I would like to invite participants to complete an online survey. In this survey, you would be asked to give details about your background, your lifestyle, and diet. Participants will rate their current mood, stress levels and complete five tasks measuring cognitive ability. This study has been approved by Northumbria University Ethics Committee. You do not need to follow a ketogenic diet to participate, as I would like to compare the impact of ketogenic diet with other diets too. If you are interested in participating and would like to know more, follow the link to the survey: [https://nupsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0CebLn8MYqrugWF](https://nupsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0CebLn8MYqrugWF)",2370317,1618913938,2021-04-20 18:18:58,149706,0,1

(The quest for keto products is having me go shopping in so many new places. LOL! I've gone to Wal-Mart more times in the past 3 months than I have in the previous 3 years, I think.)

Like Franz keto bread, Oroweat uses modified wheat starch, but this particular recipe yields 3g net carbs compared to 0g net carbs for Franz. 

I have too much bread right now, so I didn't pick this up. I typically buy Artisan Bakers keto bread from Costco. Artisan's primary ingredient is resistant tapioca starch, and like Franz, Artisan Bakers is also 0g net carbs.

The last time I was at a healthy body weight was 20 years ago in college.  Since then I slowly started adding on pounds and becoming less active.  Reaching 280 lbs in august of 2020 was a wake up call. I did some research and within 48 hours was transitioning myself into a lower carb higher fat diet.

As of today, just eight short months later, I am down to 199 pounds and feel better than I have in decades.  My middle aged belly that I thought I would never get rid of is practically nonexistent now. I went from a size 42 waste to a size 34 and from xxl shirts to large.

Each time I've done this, it's certainly been temporarily satisfying, but I've also noticed that it has produced a lot of anxiety when I switch out of ketosis (imagine this could be from the decreased GABA production when I move back into glycolysis, but it's a curious effect). I wondered if any of you folks had suggestions for how to deal with this emotional eating? If you feel tempted to gorge on sh\*tty carbs for emotional reasons, how do you deal with it?

keto,muboru,bentanner25,Some Ideas about How Keto &amp; Fasting Can Be Used Together for Weight Loss,"Recently I wrote an article and tried to put together a fairly foolproof framework for losing weight with intermittent fasting, keto, and some slightly longer fasts as well.  

I based the plan on research I've done over the past few years (different books, articles, podcasts, etc), individual success stories I've seen, and of course some of my own experience experience as well.

Here's a basic summary in case you find it useful :)

1)  Start with time-restricted eating (TRE) for a couple months or more.  Gradually shrink your eating window, slowly, so your body has some time to adapt.  

If it's working, keep going.  

A lot of people have success and reach their weight-loss goals just by doing daily TRE. 

Other people plateau after a while, and may need to try something different.

2)  Doing a ketogenic diet for at least a couple months can help get you ""fat-adapted"", and makes it easier to fast (and easier to lose body fat).

It also helps to do the ketogenic diet for a few days or more before any longer fasts. Getting your ketones up in advance significantly smooths the transition into fasting.

3)  If you've done TRE and/or keto for a while and hit any sort of weight loss plateau, one option is to try some medium-length fasts.  These are great for breaking through plateaus.

Doing a 24 hour or 36 hour fast a couple times a week is a pretty good protocol, but you can always adapt to your individual circumstances.

4) Longer fasts (&gt;36 hours) are optional, typically they're not necessary to reach your weight-loss goals. But they do have some additional health benefits, and can also speed up your weight loss.

5) Once you reach your weight-loss goal, mix and match low carb, different fasting durations, etc to balance things out and maintain your progress.

Overall, be patient, take it slow, and notice non-scale victories as well.  Your health can improve even when your weight stays the same!

That's a high level summary, but if you want more details feel free to check out the full article (and I'd be happy to hear your feedback, or personal experiences):

I eat the same 3 meals every single day, prepped in the morning and ready.  They keep easily into ketosis.  I am never hungry, and I do not eat outside of those meals.  I am different though, I view food solely as fuel.  It is no way social for me.   I do not weight myself at all.

I work out every morning except Sunday for 30 mins, HIIT only, rotating total body weights, oversized speed/heavy bag, and running twice a week each.  First thing in the morning, no chance to have a schedule conflict, it is a priority.  It is also low impact, low chance of any injury.

I have lost 130 lbs in 3 years and still average 3 lbs loss a year.   Immaculate physicals except for elevated cholesterol.  No health issues, even a cold in 3 years.

The less of a big deal you make of your efforts, the easier to fly under the radar.  I do not share keto or my efforts, because most that ask how I look so great do not really care how, just a nice way to comment me my physical appearance/change.

*Though my trigs were actually pretty low in 2015, the only thing I was doing differently was I went gluten free for a while just to try it. I'm not sure what else it could be, but those low trigs seem to be an outlier.*

It appears that it's the ratio between ApoA1 and ApoB that's important for estimating coronary disease, and while ApoB wasn't tested, its value can be calculated with reasonable accuracy if you know your LDL and trig scores.

[https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2840-11-55#:\~:text=Results,0.936%20(0.935%2C0.937)](https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2840-11-55#:~:text=Results,0.936%20(0.935%2C0.937))).

 The equation is:  ApoB = −33.12 + 0.675\*LDL + 11.95\*ln(tg)

So, with one measurement of my ApoA1 (142mg/dL, which is good) I am able to get my ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, which turns out to be a little high at 0.92.

Another meaningful indicator of coronary health is the Trig/HCL ratio, which for me is good, at about 1.7, though in the past it's been not so good, typically at around 3 but up to 5.

[https://www.beyondthebrain.net/blog/the-importance-of-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio](https://www.beyondthebrain.net/blog/the-importance-of-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio)

See my trig/HDL ratio over time here: [https://imgur.com/HQQBlbl](https://imgur.com/HQQBlbl)

**Overall I'm reasonably encouraged!** 

Areas I want to improve are trying to get back to a higher HDL level (currently 50, but was at 63 in October 2020), and try to lower that ApoB level. To do so, I'm going to try to up my oily fish intake (was already eating salmon and mackerel at least once a week, if not more frequently), and significantly increase my moderate to vigorous exercise (I've hardly even been going on walks over the last 3 months). I'll also try to get better sleep, as I'm often getting less than 6 since it's that time after everyone else is in bed that I have time to myself. Also, coffee is associated with increased ApoB so I'm going to try cut the frequency in half. I have a small coffeemaker but it still makes about 20oz of coffee at a time, or 2.5 cups. [https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/apolipoprotein-b/](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/apolipoprotein-b/)

Also, will see if I can slightly reduce my saturated fat intake and maybe fry my eggs less often in butter, but this will be a lower priority. I'm already eating a good amount of almonds and pecans every day.

keto,mu27zq,lowkeyripper,Ketosis progress questions,"Hi guys! I'm on my third week of keto and I got a couple questions for you. 

1) How can I tell if I am kicked out of Ketosis by using a device that measures the amount of ketones in your blood? Scenario would be like I ate a lot of pizza and I wanted to meausre my blood ketone level before, after 1hr, and after 8 hours. After 24 hours Im assuming I'd be back in Ketosis. Not that I ate pizza this weekend, but I did have quite a bit of snacks this weekend (e.g. almonds and fat-based dip) which have some carbs. as well as a few crystal light drink which has 2 carbs. In the worst case, if I slip up for a day, a weekend, a week...do I lose my progress towards sustained ketosis / working towards fat adaptation, like is it reset? Or would I just gain a bunch of water weight and then lose it when my body re-enters ketosis.

Basically what I am wondering is if I can be making ketones and be out of ketosis somehow...and if there's ""lag time"" between my ketosis state and blood ketones. In other words, does my meter even tell me anything useful when id need it? 

2) Can you tell that you are fat adapted by any means (i.e. ketone meter) or is it all kinda subjective experiences? Its my third week of Keto. I am obese so its not like getting fat adapted will be hard, theres plenty of it.",2369327,1618843695,2021-04-19 22:48:15,219949,4,1
keto,mu21sn,UnitedStatesSailor,Two weeks in Weight Loss and dealing with cravings,"Hey, 

Long time no see. Two years ago I posted about how I lost so much weight I also lost my shorts at the grocery store standing in line. Well I got off keto and gained all the weight back and tried restarting once or twice and just never stuck with it past a few days.

This time around I have been focusing on not looking at Keto as something I have to do, but rather as something I want to do and it’s been much easier. Just last night I felt like I was starving and didn’t give into my cravings. I treated myself to a protein bar and a glass of water and went to bed. In the past I probably would have gave in and got chips or something.

I stepped on the scale a few weeks ago and saw 228 and decided enough was enough. I will lose the weight or die trying. I’ve been fairly strict keto since. 

I’ve dropped down from 228 to 215ish as of this morning since April 8th. From April 8th to April 12th I wasn’t fully committed but gradually started cutting out carbs. Since the 12th I’ve been strict keto and the weight has been falling off steadily ever since.

I haven’t gotten keto flu, and I have not been supplementing with electrolytes at all as of yet and I’ve been feeling great. The first time I was really successful with keto I wasn’t supplementing electrolytes either and felt fantastic the whole time. 

The second and third time I tried keto I started getting all sorts of heart flutters and generally felt like crap, but I was supplementing electrolytes so I think that may have had a factor for me. Not saying at all that others shouldn’t need to supplement. Just for me I feel better without doing so.

To all the others who are struggling with this as well: I recommend really digging down deep and seeing why you want this. I know I had to face some stuff internally that I didn’t want to in order to change my mind set on eating differently. I think that I’ll be more successful this time than I was in the past.

I’m kind of writing this for myself, some motivation to keep with it. I’m feeling great so far and trying to remember I gained the weight over time and this isn’t going to be a magic bullet to drop the weight over night, though it feels like my progress is slow (I know I’m making fantastic progress).",2369326,1618843209,2021-04-19 22:40:09,220435,13,1
keto,mu1k5n,Captain_Kustaa,1st Week Experience,"Just wanted to share my experience after one week of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) for any lurkers who may be thinking about starting keto. 

For a very brief background on why I started keto and IF, over the last 5-ish years I've gone from 160ish lbs to 180ish lbs and back three or four times. Well, I'm 23 in a couple of weeks here and I'll say my body is definitely not the same as it was in my late teens. I started putting on weight faster and finding it harder to lose than before, without really changing the diet or exercise regime that I did to lose that weight previously. I got to almost 190 lbs this time and was feeling pretty damn bad about myself since it was the heaviest I'd ever been. Enter: a friend who told me about keto. 

I did quite a bit of reading and preparation before starting, which I highly recommend as this diet can be difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but more importantly it can be very unsafe. 

Before beginning, I calculated both my macros and how many calories I needed to be in a good 30%+ caloric deficit. 

During the first two-ish days I felt just fine. Adjusting to IF was easy as I've done IF before, only keto was new to me. On day three though I got two ""keto flu"" symptoms, I became lightheaded very often and suffered from nausea here and there. I had been tracking everything I ate and drank with MyFitnessPal, so after checking my nutrition tab, lo and behold I was getting less than 1/4 of the potassium and magnesium my body needs (you need to put your research into practice, gang...)

After getting K1000 brand electrolyte mix, NO-salt, and a magnesium supplement and I started taking them, these symptoms went away completely. Fast forward to the end of day 7, yesterday, I felt amazing. I have more energy than I did before, I feel more motivated to keep up with my fitness routine, and I really feel like I have more mental clarity at work. 

I lost 8lbs the first week, of which I believe 3lbs were fat. I'm thinking this because I lost 5lbs very quickly and then leveled out with no weight lost for 2 days. The initial 5lbs should all be water weight I believe. 

Summary: if you're thinking about starting out on keto, I would recommend giving it a shot. BUT expect the first week to be rough and make sure you really understand your macros and GET YOUR ELECTROLYTES!! 

Excited to see how much I lose by my birthday, which will be my 5-weeks-on-keto mark.",2369304,1618841819,2021-04-19 22:16:59,221825,4,1

keto,mtvqcl,di88,My Keto journey thoughts (and spreadsheet),"Good morning! I wanted to share my keto journey with you.

I started Keto on August 23rd, 2020, I was almost 88 kg. It was my 3rd time trying it and while it worked before as well, I never stuck with it for so long and so diligently. I also think that the lack of open restaurants helped.

You can see the spikes and lows, usually, my lowest weight was after a spike. I weigh myself daily in the morning and have a google spreadsheet where I track the date, the weight,  and whether I'm keto or not and my goals. 

https://imgur.com/a/HJOAiSY

During December I had a few more cheat meals but out of the 240 days, 220 have been keto and 20 have been cheat days (9.1%). 

Another thing I have realized this time around is that you can bounce back from a cheat meal quite fast, but if the cheat meal becomes a cheat day or if you have it too close together the impact is bigger. I have had a bit more flexibility lately to try to understand my own carb limits, I want to learn how my body reacts to certain foods and rather than a goal weight I want to have a small range that I can then manage. As I see the scale a bit higher, I am more strict.",2369032,1618818858,2021-04-19 15:54:18,244786,11,1

keto,mttlmq,Quatromoso,Short-Term Weightloss advice,"Hey all! I'm new to the keto diet and would like some basic advice, and some insight from people more informed than me for my current long term and short term goals.

\-------------

As sad as I am to say it, I have put a lot more weight on than I have intended to. 

Here's a quick run down of my history with dieting and exercise for any possible information about my individual metabolism. The info is accurate due to keeping a pretty solid history from meal tracking apps and phone notes, not fluffing any gains or losses for the sake of attention, feel free to skip if not relevant in your opinion or just too long. I started this all pretty early due to some bullying and being quite goal oriented and relatively mature at the age my fitness journey began :

\-I was quite a chubby kid despite being quite tall and naturally wide and ended up weighing around 240 lbs @ 6'0"" by the time I was in 7th grade. I was only active during the fall from (American) football, sedentary rest of year other than a few years where sever's disease left me near immobile which is when I ballooned up to 240lbs. The following summer I figured I would lose a bunch of weight. Ate around 1800 calories and ran two miles a day. Chicken breast, rice cakes, and potatoes were, no pun intended, my meat and potatoes. Lost 25 lbs over that summer (unhealthily fast, I know, but puberty was kicking me into high gear). End up entering high school at around 210-215lbs at 6'2"".

\-(2017-2018) My first 2 years of high school, I slowly worked my way back up to 240 lbs, but having football in summer and fall, weight lifting in winter, and track in the spring as well as being educated and focused on my nutrition and weight lifting schedule. I didn't follow any diet and had nights of eating junk with friends but my meals at home were basically chicken breast and potatoes in various forms. Sophomore year I was setting records in the weight room and was extremely proud of my physique and health. I was around 22% (fat caliper) body fat, but I could still run a 7:30 mile and the extra weight definitely helped with football. Also, most people guessed I was around 200 lbs. Uninformed opinions probably, but even now its hard to believe my weight at those size. For a natural 240lb high schooler, I was pretty darn lean.

\-(2019-2020) Last two years of high school was where I started slipping. Between getting a job at Burger King, settling down for a long term relationship, and most impactfully, my football coach pressuring me to put on more weight I ended up flying up to 295 lbs my senior year of high school. My weight room gains mostly plateaued from lack of nutrition and proper sleep due to work and school work load. 

\-Last year I was determined to get back into shape now that I didn't need the weight for football, but Covid had different plans leaving me without any available gyms and tons of free time and boredom to binge eat and experiment with substances, legal, but not for my age at 19. Can't blame Covid too much. At the end of the day its on me, but I can't say I was mentally prepared for the seclusion. I ended up gaining more weight and two weeks ago i weighed in at 330lbs. 

\----------------

Alright, now for the ACTUAL question and my current situation.

Every year, my family goes to Universal Studios (barring 2020 of course). In 2019, I started having trouble fitting on rides at 290 lbs.  Specifically I only had trouble on rides that had lap bars. Never had a problem with my stomach, the lap bars just wouldn't go down all the way with my thighs. I had massive thighs due to my body type and 4 years of heavy squat ( 1 rep max 530) and deadlift ( 1 rep max 590) with attention to form. Certain rides I could go on with the help of someone pushing down on the bars or special seats (embarrassing to say the least), but the new Hagrid's Motorbike ride was an absolute no go. 

10 days ago I quit the substances and started back to tracking my macros (high protein, 2000-2200 calories) and fitting in the gym when I can (2-3 times per week, working around my college and work schedule). I lost 4lbs in a week, pretty good rate with water weight loss. But doing the math, I didn't think I would make the weight I wanted for vacation so I decided to try keto. 3 days ago, I stocked up on some greens, chicken thighs, and some low carb alternatives. 

My current short term goal is to drop to 290lbs by vacation, a 30lb loss in 7 weeks. Before you understandably freak out, I know this is an unsustainable diet and have no intentions on making this a long term deal. My long term health will suffer from eating only 1800 calories a day from nutrient deficiencies and my metabolism will force me to plateau eventually. I'm including a multivitamin, potassium, and magnesium supplementation as well as a lot of vegetables to minimize any nutrient deficiencies. After vacation, I fully intend to up my calories to a sustainable range and, depending on how my little trial run with keto goes, continue it. Also, I believe my thighs are much less bulky than 2019 due to my lack of strength training during this last year. I'm hoping that will help along with the cut I am currently pursuing. My current net carb intake is under 25g/day, usually around 20g/day. The keto flu is hitting me pretty hard, but I'm staying hydrated and including those supplements as well as cooking keto alternatives. I'm rarely hungry, perhaps in part to my current subtle nausea in the afternoon. I feel good despite the fuzzy brain and weakness.

My current long term goal is to drop down to under 230 lbs within a year, get back into the groove with the gym and develop healthy long term eating habits in keto.

I have no experience with keto, only the research I've done over the past few years and wanted to hear some opinions on my short term goals given my current situation and previous fitness history if it is relevant to any predictions or insight you all have from your experience with keto. I understand that it will help the speed in which you lose weight when combined with a caloric deficit and decrease hunger. Is this true and can I be confident in my current short term goals as I stick to a 1800 calorie intake in ketosis, starting at around 325 lbs as of three days ago?

Are there any specific foods or supplements I should look into to help with such a drastic cut? 

Any problems with diet or risks I may be taking that I haven't mentioned? 

Any recipes or substitutes I should look into regarding keto (I do have a nut allergy so almond flour is sadly off the table)?

keto,mtrets,Coco_nana,What if I don't eat keto for a day? (Special occasion),"So I'm part of the wedding party for a friend's wedding that's coming up in the next year but it's been shifted to a new located across the country so more family can attend. This means I won't have the access to my regular food and kitchen, and as the only known keto attendee they aren't able to get a few exclusively keto food options without paying a lot for it. There's also a lot of allergy restrictions they have to take into account, and I'd rather that be their focus menu wise than me getting a steak. I'm obviously not upset about this, but it means I may go over/off keto for the day of the wedding especially since I can't just leave to get food inbetween the ceremony and such. I expect I'll be out and about from the early morning to late at night as it's a scenic wedding and there will be a lot of photographs after the ceremony.

So my question is, if it comes to it and I end up eating some seriously not keto food for a day, am I going to pay for it for a long time? Or will I be safe?

By the time the wedding happens I'll have been eating keto 100% for a year and a half if that matters much.

i’m a super thin girl if i’m being honest so i don’t really have to *lose weight* although MY PERSONAL body goal is to maintain a softer appearance rather than a muscular, bulky look. with my mesomorph build i tend to bulk easy and half the reason i stopped keto was because i felt like i was appearing too muscular!

today was my first day trying to transition by just lowering my carb intake (by carbs i mean lots of fruits veggies and some grains, i can’t/do not eat gluten) and upping my fats and proteins. well, i guess i hadn’t incorporated enough because it led to a big peanut butter binge! sigh haha.

i just am trying to find the form of keto that feels right and maybe hear your insight from personal experience. i felt best on a dairy free keto and plan to stick with that - but what i’m needing help with the most is feeling satiated, reaching my physique goals and never feeling the need to binge again!",2368732,1618795027,2021-04-19 09:17:07,268617,8,1
keto,mtpg70,say_ruh,I lost 10 pounds in less than 3 weeks on keto as a first-timer!,"On March 31st of this year, I was 193lb (5'5, 24F). I had been struggling with weight gain over the last two years, first with quitting my job and then of course with the panoramic (lol). I discovered this subreddit, read about the science behind keto, and decided I would give this a try. Less than three weeks later, I am now 183lb! I kept a log of all the days since I started, and I wanted to summarize each week in case it helps anyone else starting out.

Week 1: Got started with keto. Eliminated easy things from my diet, like bread, pasta, and desserts. Focused on trying to get under 50g of carbs a day to start, since I was SO used to constantly having sugary things all day. Made some mistakes with not getting enough electrolytes, but quickly learned to keep track. Went to Easter events with family, where there were very tempting food items, but managed to just eat what would fit in my diet and didn't have any sugary desserts. Quickly dropped (water) weight, which greatly motivated me to keep going.

Week 2: Set my carb limit to under 25g instead of 50g. Had one cheat meal for me and my partner's anniversary (had steak but did have some bread, sides, and bites of dessert). Continued keto the next day and haven't stopped since then. Some days were hard- I felt like the first week was the ""honeymoon"" period, whereas the second week really showed me that I'm going to make some long-term changes. This was probably the biggest test for me.

Week 3: Finally feel pretty adapted to keto. I now feel a steady stream of energy all day and I feel satiated most of the day. Lots of my cravings for sugary foods are gone.

keto,mtl3s2,bbrady86,Not in GKI ketosis- 11 months doing Keto,"Hey folks, I'll try and make this brief.  Since early this month, I've almost exclusively not been in ketosis when I test on my GKI Keto Mojo meter.  My values have been anywhere from 0.1-0.4, but mostly 0.2/0.3 almost every time I check my ketones.  During this time, my blood sugars are anywhere from 70-101mg/dl, but mostly in the 80's.  I know my carb level has been good (less than 30g/day total) and most days still 20 total or below.  I have just been much hungrier this entire month up until this point, and have therefore eaten, since I figure my body is telling me something... Mind you, I've been in a calorie deficit up until this point, so maybe my body wants to normalize or something, since when I do eat, it pretty much puts me at maintenance calories.

I've plateaued with the weight loss, which isn't a huge issue as I've experienced plateaus before.  But in the past, I was still in ketosis with all my plateaus.  I just can't seem to wrap my head around my ketone values.  I'd like to think I've just become such a well-oiled ketone producing machine that my body knows exactly how many to produce, but it's just a bit discouraging... Maybe I'm putting too much stock in it and just need some reassurance from you folks.  I'm trying to do my best with listening to my body's signals and eating when hungry, but that's led to me really not doing much IF anymore.  I'm trying to have this be a lifestyle and not a punishment, so I'm trying my best to keep a positive attitude and not intentionally starve myself just to make the ketone levels elevate and see more weight come off.

At this point, I'm down 75-80lbs in 11 months, so I really have nothing to complain about.  But I just want to see what some of you more seasoned folks think about this, because ultimately, I would like my ketone levels to be higher to facilitate more weight loss.  Lastly, I did do a 72hr fast about a month ago, in which my ketones were sky high throughout and for about a week after.  I almost think I did myself a disservice by doing that fast because my ketones have been pretty labile since.  Once again, maybe I'm putting too much stock in the numbers, but let me know what you guys think.  Thank you!",2368510,1618778772,2021-04-19 04:46:12,284872,12,1

keto,mtjrlu,youcantakeyourten,low energy,"So about two years ago I gave the keto diet a try. Which was really hard for me, I stuck with it for about a month, not for weight loss related reasons but because I genuinely wanted to help my body reduce inflammation and dependence on sugar. Now, as I did the diet, i experienced a lot of low energy, depressive spells for a while. It got so bad where I couldn't function normally and felt like I had to have some carbs to kickstart my brain enough to get to work on time, shower, and be a human. Now, I'm wondering if there's something I was doing wrong. I stayed hydrated, took electrolytes, etc. I've recently discovered I have ADD and a lot of people are recommending I get back on this diet to manage my symptoms. I've been experiencing so much brain fog and fidgety symptoms and I know it's because of sugar I intake.. I just don't know, should I try it again and risk that kind of depressive crash and hope I come out of it with better managed ADD symptoms? How long do you think is long enough to give this diet a shot? Was my slower ""depressive state"" just my brain getting back to healthier levels and I just didn't realize it?

So if I am eating 1500 cal a day, and want to eat less than 20g carbs, 1500 / 20 = 75cal per carb. 

Then to find the cal per carb in anything you’re thinking of eating, divide the calories of the food by the net carbs. 

So long as a recipe or meal has equal or more calories per carb than this number, you should be good to go.

keto,mt5nmj,gorgonflabish75,Lost 110 pounds in less than a year !,"[Progress](https://imgur.com/gallery/5yoEiCr)

Last year around March I've lost a job at the same time Covid shut down everything in my area, I spent a month in my bed browsing memes on the internet until I met someone who successfully lost around 100 pounds with keto. I was tired of being in my bed, in a situation I couldn't control and knew Covid would be the perfect opportunity to train hard, eat better and fix myself.
I've suffered from huge back pain for years and lost a lot of money on chiropractors when the only issue was my weight and lack of exercise. (I couldn't tie my shoes it was too painful to bend over but now I can rest the palm of my hands on the floor in that position !)

Time has come.

I hopped into the keto bandwagon and did intermittent fasting everyday. My diet was mostly made of fish, charcuterie, cheese, almond milk isolate shakes and lots of low carb veggies.
My appetite decreased over time like pure magic.
I cut down in half every portions of the amount of food i've used to eat and limited myself to three meals a day, sometimes two, no snacking. I also took potassium and magnesium supplements just in case.

To introduce myself to consistant exercise, I promised myself to do 30 mins a day of cardiovascular training, nothing else. Eliptical was my training of choice, then later I discovered a passion for jogging. I recently ran  a half marathon in 2 hours, I couldn't believe it. I still pinch myself to know if i'm dreaming or not.

I did that, only that from April 2020 to January 2021.
10 Months, went from 250lbs to 140lbs.
No excess, only 30 mins a day of jogging and a stable keto diet (with a cheat meal on Fridays for me.)

I must say I'm proud, happy and I can't believe it.
If I had to do it again I would certainly retake the challenge without hesitating.
Sadly, I saw a lot of people around me gaining a lot of weight during the quarantine and I truly hope my story will spark a little light of motivation in them.",2367608,1618718266,2021-04-18 11:57:46,345378,169,1

Does anyone have a recommendation for a good multivitamin for men (late twenties) that won't break my daily carb count (25gs or less/day)? Thank you in advance. First time posting here so if any additional info is needed am happy to provide!",2367589,1618717093,2021-04-18 11:38:13,346551,6,1
keto,mt58yg,aware_nightmare_85,Keto + GERD. Is it possible?,"In 2017 I lost 100 pounds with strict keto and felt great. Managed to keep it off with on-and-off lazy keto until falling off the keto wagon completely at the end of 2019. In the middle of 2020 I tried keto again but started experiencing GERD symptoms that were first misdiagnosed as sinus and asthma issues. In December a veteran ENT immediately recognized it as ""silent reflux"" aka GERD and told me to do an elimination diet: cut out all fatty and acidic foods, coffee, and carbonated drinks. The elimination diet helped until I came down with a terrible norovirus (stomach flu) over St. Patrick's Day this year; everything afterwards made my stomach hurt and nauseous as hell. Saw another random doctor - due to my PCP being overbooked - said my post-stomach flu issues was due to GERD and prescribed me to continue a bland diet and take 40mg PPI pills every morning. He also lectured me about my weight -- with neither advice nor a referral to a nutritionist -- which pissed me off.

While the meds have helped, my weight continues to creep up because a GERD-friendly diet is kryptonite to people with PCOS and insulin resistance. I love keto. I miss it. And I desperately need to get back to losing weight because it is wreaking havoc on my knees and ankles. This week I've been 75% immobile - only getting up to let my dog outside - because my knees are so swollen and stiff with obesity-related osteoarthritis. I am also tired all the time because my body can't handle the glucose from eating a bland diet, not to mention my hormones are out of whack. 

So in a nutshell: I feel like I am stuck between a rock and hard place having to choose between saving my esophagus or saving myself from type 2 diabetes. I know keto will help **my whole body** feel better but I don't want to disobey doctor's orders by starting keto again. What I want to know is if there are some people here who manage to do keto with GERD that can be managed with PPI drugs?

Tldr; is there anyone here that does keto with GERD that successfully manages it with PPI drugs?",2367576,1618716553,2021-04-18 11:29:13,347091,17,1

Green tea is one of the most well-known types of tea, and is linked with many health benefits.

It’s also one of the most effective teas for weight loss. There is substantial evidence linking green tea to decreases in both weight and body fat.

In one 2008 study, 60 obese people followed a standardized diet for 12 weeks while regularly drinking either green tea or a placebo.

Over the course of the study, those who drank green tea lost 7.3 pounds (3.3 kg) more weight than the placebo group

keto,mss64j,ChocBrew,Solve the electrolyte riddle,"Ever since going keto/low carb I feel my electrolytes were messed up, but I still can't figure out how to properly correct them. Since you guys are electrolyte experts by default maybe you could figure this out. What would you say based on these symptoms and reactions to each supplements? I've tried to supplement and add foods in many different ways and nothing seems effective so far.

Overall symptoms: Brain fog, effort to breathe (only on rare occasions I ""forget"" I'm breathing, low energy overall, threshold crampy legs.

Sodium: Makes me feel just with a little more energy and less lightheaded for a short amount of time. Taking more won't help much. Serum is always around the mid-lower healthy range.

Potassium: Instantly kills any anxiety and makes my breathing smooth, lowers cramps. The effects are very short lived and reverse into worsening symptoms in a pretty short time. Taking too much irritates stomach, increases brain fog and makes me  dizzy and weak. Serum is always around the upper healthy range.

Magnesium: This is a real riddle. Magnesium takes a while to buildup in the body so it would make a lot of sense to assume I'm depleted, after all I haven't been supplementing throughout the lowest carb periods. But I can't tolerate it at all. As little as 260mg-400mg a day will increase sleepiness(will make me sleepy the next day even if I take it at night), cramps (yeah, literally a short while after taking my muscle will threaten to cramp at the next contraction), diarrhea, and brain fog. Tried most forms (glycinate, malate, threonate), threonate is the only one that won't give me diarrhea, but same side effects. Serum is on the lower healthy range which could indicate subclinical hypomagnesemia but I can't tolerate it. Go figure....

Calcium: probably have been on a pretty low intake for a long time based on what I eat. Had a vit D deficiency a while ago, but was corrected through supplements and reached normal levels. Whenever I had a bunch of dairy or calcium rich foods I did not feel anything in particular. Serum is around the upper healthy range.",2366918,1618671216,2021-04-17 22:53:36,392428,4,1

keto,msqv1a,shoctologist,MCT Oil?,"Bottom line up front: how much value do you place in MCT oil?  And how can I ensure that I'm getting a quality MCT oil if I buy one online?

About me: I'm still relatively new to keto; I began the day after Thanksgiving last year and have been going great (with one 3-day period two weeks ago where I allowed myself to have carbs before returning to form).  I have lost 30 lbs since Thanksgiving 2020 (due in part to both keto and IF, not really exercising much yet); however, before my brief carb overload, I realized I was plateauing and not really losing much anymore.

So I started to finally keep track of my nutrient counts (I mostly just avoided eating anything with carbs, testing to ensure I never fell out of ketosis) and I realized that there are days when I have trouble getting my fat intake where it should be.  Don't get me wrong, for the most part, I have been nearly spot-on with my macros (60/30/10) without actually focusing on hitting those numbers for months, which I was surprised by, but there are days where it gets out of whack.  (Usually those are the days where I have chicken breast for dinner, as the protein/fat ratio throws things off a bit).

I decided to finally look into MCT oil, but as with everything, I don't trust any company's claims of being great.  I've seen far too much bullsh\*t... I usually go to Labdoor to check for their rating on supplements, but they don't seem to have MCT ratings.

So I wanted to come to you to ask about your preferred MCT oil; just the basic, no frills, MCT oil that you use.  Because I know if I search online for something, I'll get 1,000 different product suggestions (with at least 50,000 usages of the term ""keto"" and 20,000 ""weight loss"" on the labels) and not have any clue which is worthwhile.",2366848,1618666540,2021-04-17 21:35:40,397104,6,1

From January 5th to today I’ve lost 34.2 lbs. / 15.5 kg (5'5"", 235.2 lbs. to 201.1 lbs.). The picture shows January 9th vs. April 10th. 

In the summer of 2019 I’d gotten down to 174 lbs. from 230 lbs., then my life situation changed, then Covid happened (excuses excuses, but I succumbed to them). By January of this year I’d regained everything plus 5 lbs., and was back at a point where the weight was getting physically uncomfortable. About half of the initial weight loss was from keto, and I wanted to get back into it because not has it been the easiest and most comfortable way to stay in a calorie deficit, I generally feel amazing on it.

Especially this past fall I struggled with getting half heartedly into it again and again, only to go off it way too easy. This resulted in slower (but still...) weight gain and feeling kinda hopeless. During a particularly indulgent December, and my feet hurting a lot after work days (fairly active job), I started to prepare mentally for a different January. Seeing photos from New Years Eve was the cherry on top and I was looking forward to taking back control. 

It’s now been over 3 months back on keto, and I generally feel better than I did all of 2020. I know motivation is unreliable, but it’s still here in full force and I take advantage of it the best I can. I didn’t start out with any exercise goals beside collecting a bunch of steps on my Fitbit. Only very recently did I start c25k as I felt a genuine wish to sweat more. 

I try to stay at 20g carbs or under, allowing up to 25g if need be. The past 1.5 months I’ve incorporated IF and some 36 hr fasts and found that I absolutely love it, so that will definitely be a part of my journey going forward. This was not necessary for me to be successful with keto or weight loss at all, I was most interested in all the other benefits. Still, I didn’t expect it to suit my lifestyle as well as it has. I know I would never have bothered with this if I wasn’t already eating keto. 

Sorry for this little wall of text, I just wanted to contextualize and explain what I've been doing. I guess I felt like sharing because I just feel so *hopeful* these days, and keto plays a huge role in this.",2366708,1618658144,2021-04-17 19:15:44,405500,130,1
keto,mso3dg,Salty-Panda8150,confused/frustrated by lack of progress!!!,"Hey folks, first time posting on Reddit in general so be gentle please lol

so, I've been doing keto very successfully for about 2 months now, and I'm quite proud to announce that I'm down almost 40 pounds so far! started at a little over 400 (i know, I've been a big boi) to about 365. height is 5'11 if that matters. My issue is this, my weight loss has definitely stalled despite hitting the gym regularly 3-5 times a week doing at least 20 minutes of cardio (heart rate is about 150 the entire time after a brief warm up) and strength training broken up by muscle groups each gym day. last time I did a weigh in I was 365 and this was about a week ago. The last few days I got curious and checked again and each day tends to fluctuate from around 361 to 373! I'm really not sure what I'm doing wrong here.

&amp;#x200B;

Been doing high protein Keto OMAD since the beginning and that is also when I started working out. macros are protein 140 carbs 20 fat 180 but the only one I consistently hit is protein, I treat everything else as a limit. Calories are below 1800 which is a pretty drastic deficit for a man of my size, but I generally feel fine and have enough energy to make it through the day to day and hit the gym still.",2366658,1618654034,2021-04-17 18:07:14,409610,12,1

keto,msns9e,avp216,Help and tips with continues weight loss on Keto!,"Hello everyone! 

At the end of Last year, i decided to start Keto again and lose weight.  It has been going well thus far, but i believe progress is relatively slow, and i think i might be doing something wrong somewhere.  So, i am here looking for advice into what i can do to improve the situation! :D

&amp;#x200B;

My start point and end point are as follows:

Sepetember 2020: 124.5 Kg at 43.1 BMI

As of Today, April 17 2021: 99.4 Kg at 34.4 BMI

&amp;#x200B;

So, about 8 months to lose 25.1 Kg.  

&amp;#x200B;

While i am happy i lost weight at all, i think this might be too slow.  I am aware my body could just be a slower model lol, but i am hoping some of you fine individuals could help me improve this \^\_\^

I am going for the following macros ideally:

5% Carbs

25% Protein

70% Fat

1500 Calories

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, i stay just under the macros, but sometimes i exceed a bit depending on meal.  But i have did my best to adhere to this as best as possible.  My main issue is staying under the CALORIE limit to reach my fat goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have rambled on long enough!  Any insight into how i could improve would be amazing!

Thank you in advice, and i hope you all have a pleasant day :D",2366645,1618652375,2021-04-17 17:39:35,411269,8,1

keto,msnmby,-HyperConnectivity-,How to unify protein restriction with weight training?,"Hello all.  


I often see the recommendations to limit protein intake to a maximum of 25-35 g per meal, as this is what the body is able to utilize for muscle synthesis and that excess protein may be unproductive to ketosis, as it will convert to glucose.   


And yet, as someone attempting to gain muscle mass by bodyweight training, while eating two meals a day within an 8 hour window. Eating only 25-35 g of protein per meal seems sort of silly, if no detrimental to progress.   


Do you know how high protein or adequate protein for muscle building can be unified with ketogenic eating for maximum benefit in both areas?",2366630,1618651465,2021-04-17 17:24:25,412179,10,1

I have decided to slowly transition out of the lchf way of eating into more of a 40/30/30 c/f/p macro split, for several reasons.

Do you have any points I should be aware of?
I will stay at clear goals like keeping processed sugar out, only drinking water and not drinking my calories. But I am a bit afraid of messing up with reintroducing carbs into my diet again.

I have dabbled with Keto in 2017 and did ok for a couple months, but I always found a way to justify “cheating” and I quickly got bored and gained whatever I had lost. I was 277lbs. I started an office job the same year and as of March 22nd of this year I was 353lbs. It hurts to even type that number. I had had enough. I gained 50lbs in 2020 alone.

March 22nd I jumped head first Into Keto. 20g of carbs or less. I am down 24.6lbs. I have way more energy, clothes are fitting better. Im not nearly as Hungry as before. I would eat big meals morning, noon and evening. Not to mention snacks at night. Now I am IF 16/8’ish and generally have two small meals a day. My goal is 100lbs.

keto,mskw73,stormthegates8,Why Round 3 is Different,"I’ll start this off with my first two weight loss journeys to give you an idea of where I have been and where I am at now. I hope it gives someone out there the motivation they need to find the lifestyle that works best for them, keto or not.

My first weight loss journey in 2013 was based on calorie restriction and cardio. I paid no mind to macros since I didn’t know what a macro was... I just focused on eating healthy foods and made sure I had a big calorie deficit while hitting the gym for 45 minutes a day. I lost 30 pounds in 3 months. I was stuck at 166 pounds for about a week before I became so discouraged, I gave up. I hit a plateau and didn’t know how to break it. Instead of being patient and trying to work through it, I went back to my old bad habits.

My second weight loss journey was in 2018. I had hit 209 pounds on the scale... my heaviest ever, outside of being 230 pounds when i was 9 months pregnant with my son. NOPE! I started a low fat diet. That, working 2 fairly active full-time jobs, AND going to the gym, helped me shed 47 pounds in 4 months. My progress went downhill when I switched to 3rd shift at one of my jobs. I was stuck at 162 pounds and didn’t have the patience to break through the plateau. I didn’t give up on myself immediately this time, but I lost it over time and ended up gaining all but 5 pounds back within the next few years.

Here we are. Round 3. Sitting at 204 pounds and struggling to stay awake past 6:30pm every day, I knew changes had to be made. I joined and followed social media groups for the top trending lifestyle: Keto. I read through so many progress posts and most people have done so well with it. I decided to look into this way of life a little more and read about carb restriction. The ONE thing I haven’t yet targeted! I then stumbled upon an article about carb sensitivity and the warning signs. I will be damned. I relate to every single sign. That day I discovered that I really need to limit my carbs and I decided that Keto is probably best for me, personally. 

I started this journey 2 and a half months ago in February and I’m already down almost 40 pounds. This time, with minimal exercise and working only one job. With this new diet, paired with intermittent fasting, there is no doubt in my mind that I will finally make it through the 160’s and maybe even reach my ultimate goal of 145 pounds. A goal that I have repeatedly failed to achieve for 7 years now. With the knowledge and experience I have this time around, I WILL succeed. Only 20 more pounds to go. The last 20.

So I am doing intermittent fasting and decided to combine it with keto. 
Yesterday was the first day and let me tell you it is hard. 

I think which makes it worse for me that I don't cook and don't like cooking. I mean I can do simple cooking, but the full professional cooking that require me standing on the stove for long time, manipulating food items,  or actually being there to do it is impossible for me. 

Also the veggies and the stuff required for keto is expensive and I don't like sea food. 

Yesterday I ate some boiled egg with tomato, cucumber and lemon. 
Today I spent almost an hour deciding what to do  staring at the fridge. I ended up frying some cauliflower and meat chuncks. ( There is no  name for this meal because I just decided to fry them since they are keto items). When I think about what to do tomorrow, my brain is blank.

Each two-box pack was ~$11 and each box has 7 1-cup servings, bringing each serving to about $1.57 a serving. Some other keto cereals come in slightly lower, some slightly higher (based on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/lb618l/keto_cereal_comparison_schoolyard_snacks_magic/)).

As the picture in the link above partially indicates, they are chocolate and cinnamon flavor cereal puffs and they each seemingly have the same nutrition facts. I've tried the cinnamon and it definitely felt like I was eating Cinnamon Toast crunch in Kix form. Nice cereal-like crunch, even sitting in almond milk for a while.

Not perfectly 0 carbs, but 3g net ain't bad and it's nice to have options! (here's [the nutrition label](https://imgur.com/OGrR9ND))

keto,msbp2u,FurryLarper69,How do I know when to stop supplementing my electrolytes?,"Hello, I have always been ""low-carb"" but am about a month in for a strict Keto diet. My primary motivation for doing so is to boost my focus, in addition to all the other health benefits.  Long story short, I quit caffeine and nicotine about a year and a half ago but my focus dropped off a cliff.  To make up for it I thought I'd try a real keto diet (not just low carb) and I take some nootropics like Lion's Mane and L-Theanine. I manage to stay well below 20 net carbs per day and I intermittently fast using the 16/8 method. I can happily say that the combination of Keto + Nootropics has brought my focus back to the point where I can code (I'm a web developer) long hours into the night like I used to before I quit all forms of caffeine.

The downside to all this however is that since the first few days on Keto I have developed a persistent non-stop muscle twitch. It is mostly in both my legs (thighs, knees, and calfs), my feet, and occasionally my arms and eyelid. None of it is localized, it appears to be random, and I can always feel it at rest (so hundreds of times a day). All signs and everything I could read up on pointed towards an electrolyte imbalance (had a brief few days where I was certain it was MS or ALS lol). I decided to experiment and started taking a liquis magnesium supplement. The twitches subsided big time, although not disappear completely. To test my hypothesis further after a few weeks of taking the magnesium supplement I stopped just to see what would happen. What happened was my muscle twitches ramped back up from 10 to 100, and got as bad as they were when. I first started Keto. 

Having said all that and noticing the correlation between the twitches, and taking the magnesium supplement and not taking it, my question for you fine educated folks is ""at what point do I stop taking the magnesium?"" I can almost say for a certainty that the difference in twitches is huge between when I'm taking it and not. Is there any other electrolyte supplement I should be looking out for to help with the twitches as well?  If these supplements are indeed helping with the twitches and they come back when I'm not taking the supplements, is there a point in Keto where the electrolytes will balance itself out and the twitching will stop?

I need advice from y'all. It's pretty much what the title sounds like. I have been doing keto for a little over a month now and have a bachelorette weekend to go to next weekend. Friday night, we are staying in the cabin and cooking dinner; I've decided that worst case scenario, I will have a shake or eggs for dinner if I can't eat what is offered. My issue comes on Saturday; I already do IF so I am not planning on eating breakfast with the rest of the crew (I will just order a hot tea or something). BUT for lunch we are going to a popular taco place (White Duck Taco in Asheville, for those of you in the area). I have been scouring their website for nutrition info but they literally do not post anything (UGH). I think I can get away with the fish taco in lettuce with pico de gallo and avocado crema (but without their nutrition facts, I really can't track macros). I also was looking at the ceviche as an option. ALSO, I have no idea where we are going to dinner so I really can't plan in advance, but might just pick a salad or if they have a protein then doing that. My issue is, I really don't know how many hidden carbs are in any of these things! Has anyone had success on travels like this? Looking for advice, anecdotes, or any hacks that y'all have to offer! I really do not want to break my keto streak!

keto,ms700m,Chadarius,Anyone with Diverticulitis and keto/carnivore experiences?,"I've been doing keto/ketovore for two years. It has been amazing. I've lost 120 lbs. My back, knee, and hip pain have almost all gone away. I have all day long energy and don't get the afternoon doldrums anymore. I'm off my blood pressure meds, and I'm no longer pre diabetic. My bloodwork has been awesome!

However, I've found that I have diverticulosis, and recently I had an attack of diverticulitis (basically an infection and massive bloating, swelling, etc...). I believe that it was due to eating some miracle noodles (basically straight up indigestible fiber) and more veggies than I usually have for our family's special Valentine's day weekend.  I was put on antibiotics and a scan confirmed diverticulitis. It was a few horrible days of feeling like there was a football in my gut, but it seemed to heal up rather quickly by fasting (just beef or chicken broth) for about 3 days. Then slowly adding in some basic foods like eggs and ground beef with salt only. 

Feeling pretty normal again 7 weeks later, I ate some dolmades (sausage stuffed grape leaves) and cauliflower falafel on Easter. They were all home made and keto, even the sausage. The falafel was made with cauliflower rice. But once again I had more very high fiber veggies than I usually do and started building up to an attack 9 days later. It wasn't quite as bad as the first time because I had a better understanding of what was going on and went to the Dr for antibiotics ealier, but it sure isn't what I would call fun.

I am back on fasting for the last 3 days. I've only had about 4 cups of broth each day along with water, and I'm supplementing with electrolytes and salt. I'll start on a few eggs per day over the next week and slowly work my way back.

Has anyone had success with fighting off diverticulitis with keto or carnivore? What was your experience? I feel I can track it down to days that I had high fiber stuff and probably over ate a little bit on holiday occasions. But I'm interested to know if others have had other experiences?

I'll be having my first colonoscopy over the summer after everything heals up and I want to get my insides as clean and healed as possible over the next few months.",2365765,1618590927,2021-04-17 00:35:27,472717,11,1

I'm not new to community and been a lurker for a while. I also tried keto few times before but kept failing and giving up due to very slow results, laziness, and crap I've been dealing with at those times.

On metformin I'm as if a pregnant woman with extreme case of morning sickness, only that I'm not pregnant and that sickness lasts 24/7, with very bad stomach cramps on most days.

I've tried searching the Keto subreddit for any experiences with insulin resistance but found very little info so decided to ask.

keto,ms4fj8,EaglesFan0823,Health question: Hypo Symptoms fixed briefly by Keto.,"So I've been having this issue for over 2 years now. I feel brain fog, spacey, lack of motivation, hungry all the time. I generally feel no excitement. I can't drink caffeine because it triggers a lot of these feelings. I am 36 years old 6'1 270 lbs. I work a blue collar job and I struggle with it now. I used to powerlift so I have a bunch of muscle on my frame. I'm currently on Atorvastin for cholesterol and have been for a long time, testosterone cypionate every two weeks for hypogonadism, and I take beta blockers 10mg when I have to because I get anxious driving now because I'm afraid to get spacey in traffic. And as of 5 weeks ago my doctor started me on Metformin 500mg twice a day.

I am seeing an endo and she put me on metformin just to try it because she can't come up with anything else. We have done blood work after blood work. The only thing it showed recently was my RBC count was getting a little high. My fasting cortisol and insulin have been normal. I have had chest and head xrays and MRI's and they found nothing. I have seen a neurologist and he found nothing. 

So I came across a post on r/Brainfog touting the effectiveness of going full keto if you suspect you have hyperinsulinemia. I went ahead and did this in August. By day 3 all of my symptoms were gone. No more lightheadedness 2 hours after eating. No more never ending cycle of needing to eat. It was heaven. I was able to drink alcohol again with no long term effects. I lost 11 lbs and was down to 259. I was bike riding occasionally during this and that didn't affect me like it used to. That lasted 5 weeks. Then all of symptoms came back. Not as aggressive but I'd say 75% of what they were. 

Since then my doc gave me a Dexcom BS monitor to try. During the first 10 day run my BS was perfect. Now I'm doing this second run and I've introduced working out. My symptoms are growing worse. Any time I do any weight lifting I am starving for the next 3 days. Nothing fixes my hunger, I'm extremely lightheaded. I did 4 sets of squats along with some cardio on Wednesday and ate a sensible keto dinner after. Yesterday I felt the worst I've felt in years. No food satiated my hunger. Last night I went to bed with a headache. I feel my body retaining water. My BS monitor showed my BS bounced up and down all night. Anywhere from 131 to 86. The previous 10 day cycle showed nothing like this. 

I feel awful the next day if I go over my 30 carbs the previous day.
I'm not losing any weight like I did the first 2 weeks. Everyone says losing weight will help but whenever I restrict eating all my symptoms come back harder than ever. 

My questions are this: could this be an adrenal issue? Could weightlifting be triggering it somehow? Should I take a break from keto? I keep hoping to get anther 5 weeks like I had in the beginning. Is this just hyperinsulinemia like I suspect? Are there any other tests I can request?  Any help is greatly greatly appreciated. Thank you.",2365644,1618583620,2021-04-16 22:33:40,480024,43,1

But for my own good I need to leave. 

Reading all those story's about macros and weight loss makes me obsessive about my own.

I cant measure every gram of food anymore. I cant get on the scale 2 or 3 times a day. 

Iam trying to stop being obsessive about the numbers. Weighing and measuring once a month. 
And if I wanna eat raw carrots I will. Even tough it doesnt fit in my macros. It is still much better then a chocolate bar. 

So yeah I have to leave to stop. My body got healthy but by brain and relationship with food not yet. Take care!!",2365447,1618570189,2021-04-16 18:49:49,493455,1,1
keto,ms00qo,claesto,"Keto lifestyle initiated, thanks to strict medical follow-up on Pronokal","I think some background story is appropriate. I've been always a *sports kind of guy* through high school and early twenties. However after 25, I started to gain weight. Slow at first and probably some can relate that each time I was on the scale, you say to yourself *this isn't that bad...*. If you keep doing this, get less active because of a hectic professional and personal life and include eating out, or choosing fast-food instead of cooking up something decent, it adds up pretty fast.

Fast-forward to the present, at 38, and the weight scale showed a scaring 102 kg (224 pounds). Now before I had tried keto, with success. The first time I saw that I was going to +100kg, I managed to get it back down to 94kg (207 pounds). Which is still too heavy since I'm 1m75 (5 feet 8 57⁄64 inches) but I was on a roll, right? Then Covid happened.

Seated at home, permanently but lucky enough to still have work, bread and pastas were within arms reach and I started to gain weight again and an alarming rate until present day.

Having failed to stick to a keto lifestyle, since we all know it's not a diet, I decided that I needed guidance.

## Pronokal

I'm not sure how popular or familiar people are with the Pronokal method but in Belgium it's a *kind of* diet under the supervision of a doctor. Every two weeks I check in, measurements are taken and every four weeks my blood gets tested.

The diet consists of Pronokal products of their own, combined with 400 grams (1 1/2 cups) of largely green vegetables (very restricted which ones are allowed). Once you reach a certain target weight, you progress to the next step where you'll replace some of their own products with lean meat or chicken for instance.

At the end, you should be eating more or less keto-ish. I know or believe they re-introduce carbs into the diet as well at some point but I'm far from that moment in time. The doctor checkup continues up until two years after your last step to make sure you made the correct food adaptions and don't relapse.

A lot of questions remain to be answered but it seems that I really need the doctor follow-up to motivate me and to continue.

## Progress

I started this new *adventure* on March 15th, at 102kg (224 pounds) and the scale this morning after a month indicated 90,7kg (199,95 pounds) so that's a loss of about **11 kg (24 pounds)** in one month.

I'm sure the weight loss will slow down after this initial step 1 once I introduce different kind of foods again.

## Surprises

I'm really surprised that I don't miss the carbs, sugars, etc. I used to *really* enjoy food. Having two plates of pasta and ice cream afterwards. Eating lots of bread each day and drinking *zero* beverages. I was afraid I'd miss all those. Don't get me wrong, we're a family of four and I'm the only one on *a diet*. It's not difficult but sure the smell of french fries with steak from the other people in the family smells delicious. But I think a key factor to  the success of *this* and keto in general, is that there are no cravings. I'm full after eating, feeling full for a long time and **mental clarity** is insane.

I used to be one of those people that would forget *anything* unless I wrote it down in some todo-list or a notes app. Right now, I remember work-related discussions from four weeks ago like they happened yesterday.

It's still a long journey ahead until I reach my target weight of 73kg (161 pounds) but right now, it's looking great and most important I'm feeling great!",2365403,1618567320,2021-04-16 18:02:00,496324,4,1

It's been 3 days since I started the keto diet for the first time

I have a little problem though, I'm a difficult sleeper and have struggled with sleeping problems throughout my life, mostly because it takes me a while to fall asleep. Since starting Keto I've found it a bit harder to fall asleep. Maybe this is placebo, but I feel like carbs definitely helped me sleep faster. Now the sleep itself is quite deep and fulfilling compared to when i'm on carbs, but my dreams are a little scary, I also dreamt this morning that I woke up 3 times in a row, which was unsettling for about 10 minutes after I woke up. I could attribute that to anxiety associated with starting a new diet that drastically changes my eating habits, but idk.

keto,mrym7a,AntiqueLocal4735,Disheartening results,"I started keto primarily for weight loss after finding myself the heaviest I’ve ever been despite starving myself and calorie counting which only led to binging and a poor relationship with food.

Last Thursday I had two gallbladder attacks. The second one was much worse, so I went to the ER. I have sludge and gallstones. I don’t need emergency surgery yet, but my gallbladder needs to go eventually. I was told to do a strict no fat diet and talk to a general surgeon ASAP.

My consult with the surgeon is next Wednesday and I’ve been trying to watch the fat. I tested a small sandwich with some mayo and cheese, which gave me another attack. After 3.5 hours I gave in and took the percocet I was given. I can apparently handle a few grams at a time spread out over the day, but I can’t eat at all like I was.

I am so frustrated. I’ve been doing so well and now I’ve eaten lucky charms out of frustration because it tastes good and doesn’t make me hurt. I just want eggs or nuts or a burger or butter on my veggies.

I'm not watching my macros, because it's too difficult for me, and I'm trying to keep my calories under 1200 a day--  and I think I'm doing that, because most days I only eat one meal maybe two.  I've been doing IF without realizing it, so I know I'm doing this well.  I have not 'cheated' once since starting this.  I've got to lose weight for two foot surgeries, so I am SERIOUS.

Does it sounds correct to you guys, that out of 9 lbs, nearly 3 of those were fat?  I try to get on this scale every day, first thing in the morning. The more you use it, the more info it saves and adjusts and tells you.  It's pretty darn cool.  I didn't notice the info about the fat until today, because I'm legally blind, and it's really hard to see my iPhone and all of the data it is gathering. 

So--  thoughts?  If this scale is correct, it's saying 1/3 of the weight I've lost is actual fat.  Should the percentage be higher?  What is the other 2/3 made of?  Oh, ALSO!-- I have been lifting two 8 gallon milk jugs every day now for three solid weeks, trying to build up some strength in my arms.  Five arm exercises, and 3 types of squats.  The amount of muscle the scale says I'm creating is very low, just a tiny %, but I'm trying!  I keep going....",2364591,1618516824,2021-04-16 04:00:24,546820,16,1

keto,mrlpx4,socal-chicana,The keto plan I gave my sister,"So many people have messaged me or asked on my earlier post what I told her when she asked me how I'd lost the weight and I told her about keto I thought I'd post it here. As always, I urge you to read this sub's FAQ. It's been my rock and I'm not even exaggerating.

I basically summarized the FAQ plus my own little interventions:

* Try to keep your carbs under 20 a day but if you do go over, don't let it derail you, just keep them as low as you can for the rest of the day.
* Lean into protein. Make sure you're getting at least 100 grams a day even if you need to go over your deficit calories to get there.
* Drink ketoade and use salt on your food. (I gave her the FAQ recipe)
* Weigh and track your food as much as you can. Again, if you can't, don't let it derail you. Do your best and keep going. 
* Use a food tracker all the time, every day. If you stop, start again when you can. (She uses CarbManager, I did, but now use Cronometer.)
* If there is something you really want and will feel deprived and resentful without it, make sure you're already full (if you can) and have one bite of the thing. Count it as 5 carbs (it probably won't be that much) and then get rid of the rest. The first bite is always the best anyway.
* Be kind to yourself. This is not a punishment. It's not that you ""can't have carbs,"" it's that you don't want them. 
* If you stop eating keto you're not cheating. You're just not eating keto. It will be there when you're ready to come back to it. 

That's pretty much it. When she's had questions I've answered them. She told me she's gone off keto sometimes, but always gotten back on with the next meal.

So back on Jan 4th I started keto and introduced IF after about 2 weeks. All went well til about 6 weeks ago. I got a stead 1-2 lbs a week after the initial big drop of about 8lbs in 1 week. I was doing 16:8 and then 36h before a cheat day. I got stuck about 4-6 weeks ago at 151-153. It fluctuated between those and nothing helped. 

About 4 weeks ago I got into a stressful situation between buying a house, work, and I ended up getting tonsilitis. I didn’t really keto but kinda did IF and generally did OMAD which didn’t bother me really, for a few days at a time but no schedule on it. 

I started easing back into things about 2 days ago doing the OMAD and keto since yesterday. And this morning, I broke the 150 (148.8!) which seems weird. 

I wonder is keto even worth the extra hassle? Am I better doing IF only but keep it reasonable for that meal?

Does anyone have advice or feedback on this?

keto,mrit6e,sowmi245,Is the Keto Diet Right for You?,"Although the conversation about the Ketogenic diet is widespread, many people still find it challenging to tell what is fact or fiction. In this article, you will gain insights into the myths and facts surrounding the Ketogenic diet.

**What Is Exactly Is a Keto Diet?**

The Keto diet works on the principle that by depleting carbohydrates, you will burn fat for fuel, hence maximizing weight loss. It entails a gradual reduction of carbs intake and replacing it with fats.

**Keto Diet Myths/Facts**

Here are the common Keto diet myths and facts.

**Myth 1:** You Can Consume Any Fat

**Fact:** When practicing Ketogenic, people consume healthy fats. If you want to keep fit, avoid saturated fats, and focus on organic foods rich in fiber. To prevent any stomach discomfort, space out the quantity of your daily fat intake.

**Myth 2**: Weight Loss is the Only Benefit of Keto Diet

Fact: Contrary to what many believe, the Keto diet has immense benefits other than weight loss. For instance, it enhances cognitive function, boosts gut health, regulates body hormones, and stabilizes blood sugar levels.

**Myth 3:** You Don't Need to Exercise

Fact: Exercising is highly recommended when you are on a Keto diet. However, to achieve more out of workouts, ensure you eat adequately, and allow enough time for recovery. To exercise, you may need more carbs, and it is essential to up your carb consumption on workout days.

**Myth 4:** Your Muscle Mass Will Reduce

Fact: As opposed to the myth, people who follow the diet while doing strength exercises gain muscles.

**Myth 4:** It Is Characterized By Fatigue

**Fact:** During the adjustment period of the diet, you may feel tired, but that condition will diminish with time. More importantly, not everyone experiences fatigue during dieting. However, if you encounter it, bear in mind that it won't last beyond a week.

**Myth 5:** The Diet is for a Short Period

Fact: The duration of the diet intake depends on your health and fitness goals. In most cases, the standard period is between three to five months. After this phase, you may revert to your regular eating patterns for some weeks.

**Myth 6:** There is no Science behind the Diet

Facts: Several scientific studies support the Ketogenic diet. For instance, particular research shows that the diet was initially created to help epileptic patients regulate seizures. Additionally, the diet helps reduce or maintain body weight.

**Myth 7:** Rich in a Lot of Fats and Proteins

**Fact:** The diet doesn't contain high fats and proteins. Depending on one's training goals, the macronutrient is apportioned based on individual requirements. For example, the typical macronutrient split for this diet includes low carbs, high fat, and moderate protein.

**Myth 8:** Causes Heart Attack

**Fact:** Keto diet encompasses the intake of saturated fats, which doesn't cause a heart attack.

**Final Thoughts**

This diet can help you improve your fitness and health goals. If you want to succeed from the diet, it is vital to scrutinize the myths surrounding the diet and adopt evidence-based facts.",2364368,1618505528,2021-04-16 00:52:08,558116,0,1

keto,mrihao,Pink_Shark01,fat adaptation question - glucose levels management,"Fat-adapted ketoers and their energy source management (aka glucose management)

Hello! I came here to get some clarification and confirmation of my understating of energy source management.

Say, *a carb-burner* decides to go keto. Carb-burner's primary source of fuel is carbs (aka glycogen). Once carbs (glycogen) is depleted from muscles and liver reserves, his body will start switching to fat-burning. Once he went through 100 rounds of hell of keto flu, his body is learning to adapt to using fat for energy (on the condition that carb-burner stops eating carbs). 

And we have *a fat-burner* \- a fat-adapted person, ketoing for months. A fat-burner's primary source of fuel is fat.  (Although he relies on fat mostly throughout the day/night to give him energy, after he ate, he will still have a glucose spike. Depending on food he ate, the spike will either be steep up and steep down (if he ate a bagel for e.g.) or the spike will be more like a hill (if he ate 3 eggs for e.g.). But he will still have an increase in glucose levels-&gt; meaning that this glucose will go into muscles and liver --&gt; **meaning that he will be relying on glucose for some time after food intake**. 

HERE COMES THE QUESTION(S) --&gt;) 

Now, about this last bit of the sequence - as his glucose goes up, his ketones go down. **(1)** Does this mean that he switches to using glycogen as the energy source until his glucose goes down/ketones go up? OR he keeps using fat as the energy source and carbs that he ate will go into reserves. **(2)** Is there a ""max capacity"" of glucose reserves? If his reserves are full (from previous food intake e.g.), what happens with the carbs he ate during the meal?

So, I'm my understanding, being fat-adapted effectively means managing your glucose levels. After you ate, you restore glycogen and use it as fuel until next meal. After few hours your glucose goes down/ketones go up and you start using fat for fuel, then you eat again and this circle goes on until you go to sleep. Effectively, following the above piece, you actually have a prolonged period of burning fat **only** after your last meal (e.g. dinner). When you practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) (with a lunch &amp; dinner regimen), you will use fat for fuel only during the night and until your lunch next day. Question number **(3)** \- does this mean that if you do **not** follow intermittent fasting and consume something 3-5 times a day (doesn't have to be full meals but something that breaks your fast), you effectively always use glycogen as fuel rather than fat because your glucose goes up and down and you do not give your ketones a chance to ""override"" glucose? Following the above - an IF is a must on keto because otherwise you just do not use fat for fuel other than at night. Here is where I am struggling to understand fat-adaptation. 

To the title of this post - is fat-adaption all about glucose management as written above? 

I hope its clear what I mean and would appreciate your takeaway on the glucose management situation :)

keto,mrhija,DwightSchnoop,I didn’t relapse,"I’m in absolute awe of myself. 

Firstly let me say, I call it relapsing because as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I know when I want something vs when I’m clucking for it. I’m a year and two weeks sober, and in replacement of the sauce and sparkle I used food. I’m now 5’7 and 92kg. Long and short, the floor boards squeak. 

I have been on keto for two weeks. I’ve logged my food, I’ve nailed my cooking and I have absolutely bloody loved it. Yoga everyday, walk everyday, building up little by little to the healthiest me. 

But today I had a vision of getting a massive cake with icing (I saw it on TV - the type of cake you want to buy a drink and lick all over) and I wanted to stick a fork in it and eat it until I felt sick and bin the rest. I don’t even like cake. It was never my thing but I had that addict twinge. I knew sugar was going to be tough to ditch but after you’ve given up cocaine and champagne, sugar was the lesser of two evils... so I thought.

I realised recently if I kept giving in to sugar, pretty soon I was going to give in to alcohol again. If I can’t acknowledge and address these addict ticks that set me off and cut them off, I’m going to relapse. 

So I turned back around. I stopped walking to my local bakery, turned around and came back home. Made an enormous cup of camomile tea and meditated. 

I found a higher power somewhere along the way today. I am grateful to be a part of this community and I am so grateful I have a safe space to share my small triumph.

I am considering getting off keto and instead doing the  slow carb diet but I have almost 60 pounds to lose to get to a comfortable weight. Anyone else experienced this? Looking for advice . Thanks",2364191,1618491905,2021-04-15 21:05:05,571739,14,1

I’ve had it this time too, I look better in the mirror and to others. I weigh less, in fact, I’m below my pre pregnancy weight but you couldn’t tell looking at me because my stomach got destroyed. 

I’ll go all day eating well, meats, cheeses, veggies. By the time I put my toddler to sleep, I’m craving anything I cannot eat on keto. And worse is that it’s food I’m not even making ! I use DoorDash or Uber eats-and I binge. Every time I do this, I tell myself that it’s the last time and this doesn’t taste as good as you want to look! It doesn’t bloody work. 

I’m not asking for a solution, I know this is my fault and there isn’t an answer I’m specifically looking for- i just wanted to share my struggles with the community here.

keto,mrbd4v,phpfree,Keto Diet Plan for Weight Loss,"The whole world is now combating a common problem of human life called [obesity](https://www.fitex.club/some-unknown-things-about-weight-loss-you-should-know/). Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.

**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**

A question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.

A Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.

**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**

Changing to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.

During the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.

**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**

Since you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled. Without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating, you may have mood swings as well. So here are some of the best foods that you can eat during your Keto diet.

**1. Meat**

Meat is a very good source of protein. It will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body. There are varieties of meat that are available in the market. Most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton, beef, pork, and so on. But here in the Keto diet, you can easily go for all kinds of meats. In other weight-loss diets, the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in. but in this case, you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein, you also need ample amounts of fat too.

**2. Fish**

Sea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids. They are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health. On the other hand, it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the Keto diet plan. Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout can be very good options for those who are going through their Keto diet plan.

**3. Dairy Products**

Milk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet. Milk contains almost all kinds of micro-nutrients which are really necessary. It also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too. Other than that, cheese, butter, and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the Keto diet.

**4. Nuts and Oilseeds**

These are very important parts of the Keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health. Almonds, walnuts, cashew, peanut along with flaxseed, pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in Keto diets. You can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy.

**5. Vegetables**

Filled with vitamins and minerals, vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the Keto diet. Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.

**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**

When you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.

The first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.

On the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.

So far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.

They are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.

**Benefits of Keto Diet**

1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.

2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.

3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.

4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.

5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.

6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.

7. It also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too.",2364095,1618479529,2021-04-15 17:38:49,584115,4,1
keto,mrako9,Sanso14,Net Carbs in UK,"Hi,

I think I have been counting my net carbs incorrectly. I have been logging all food intake into Fitbit, the below are my results from yesterday.

Calories - 1697 , Fat - 127.6 , Fiber - 12.4 , Carbs - 22.3 , Sodium - 505.9 (I am supplementing) , Protein - 110.7 

Composition - 5% Carbs, 69% Fat, 26% Protein

I am burning around 4000 calories a day, no specific workout routine but going for daily hour long brisk walks.

I am losing weight at a good pace, a bit concerned about losing muscle mass, but my main issue is that I have been subtracting Fiber from Carbs as you see above (yesterday was 9.9 Net Carbs) but I have some conflicting information that the nutrition labels in the UK are Net for the line that reads 'Total Carbs' - does anyone have any further information on this or can confirm its true?

keto,mr9six,PuddleOfMush,Am I doing this right? (many questions),"About a week ago I committed to keto, I've spent the past week kind of easing myself into the diet, so today was my first day actually tracking and calculating my macros.

So for my first tracked day, this is what I've got:

1183 calories, 22.5 grams carbs, 94.8 grams fats, 69.1 grams protein. Percentages are 7%, 70%, 23% respectively. 

Will this work? Am I supposed to be getting more calories?

Also, how do I go about getting the other vitamins and nutrients when most fruits and a lot of vegetables are too high in carbs? Is zero sugar Gatorade good enough for replenishing electrolytes, or is there a better source?",2364033,1618471793,2021-04-15 15:29:53,591851,5,1

But, while I'm happy with the weight loss, my stomach does not seem to be shrinking at all. I am losing weight in my face, hands, feet and legs, but not where I most want to.

So I’ve been tracking my calories and amount of carbs and apart from 2 days where I purposefully went over (in terms of carbs), this past month I’ve consistently stayed at around 1200 or less calories a day, at least on average.

In the past 1 week though I haven’t seen any change in weight at all, in fact if anything a slight increase. It’s a little disheartening as keto is obviously a lot of effort. Usually I would see a loss of weight almost daily, but I haven’t dropped anything since 8 days ago.

Bending down to bathe him. Walking him up and down stairs to change him etc. Everything sucked and hurt. I needed change. 

I started doing keto casually since November 2020. I didn't weigh myself at first so I had to check my weight against my doctor visit in January of last year. Checking last week I've lost 75.9 lbs without working out yet. A few weeks after I started taking it serious I noticed I have a lot more energy. I had my first soda this weekend. Coke zero and sprite zero. But I have gone hard with sparkle water and thats now my go to if I get a craving. 

I've been stuck at this weight for the past few weeks. I stopped using the carb manager to track my meals. Ever since they did that update a few months ago I don't care for it anymore. My goal is to lose another 75 by August. Gotta start actually working out. I got a bike seat for the baby. He will love it. Also received a bike trailer for his first birthday in case the seat doesn't work out.

keto,mqzcx5,Crescentia-Fortuna,How to actually balance meals / where to get the fat?,"Hello!
I would like to give keto a try, and I've read a bunch of general things now, as well as reading through the food list with accepteble foods for keto.

So 5% carbs, 35% protein, 60% fat it is... but looking at the list of food, where do I get the fat from and how much in actual weight do I need of it?

Eating meat, skipping carbs by swapping them out with green veggies is what comes to mind for me, but I feel like I would end up eating too much protein and don't actually get the fat that I need like this.

And with the lists alone, I just can't quite grasp how much I need to eat of what to achieve this 5/35/60 ratio.

So I wanted to ask if someone could give me an example of a meal that I could theoretically eat every day that would give me all the important nutreints and keeps the ratio.
Of course I don't intent to actually only eat this one meal forever, but I think it would help me understand how to structure my meals. (As in, how many grams of meat +  gramms of veggies + gramms of whatever the fat comes from) 

I usually eat 2 meals a day (brunch and dinner)
so a suggestion for brunch + dinner would be nice.

I'm a huge sweet tooth and snacker, so combined with my small frame and general disposition to sedentary hobbies, it was way easier to pack it on than it was to lose it through strictly CICO. Keto had helped me finally crack that sweet tooth and appreciate a wider variety of foods and flavors.

But this weekend, I feel like I really turned a new leaf! My partner was looking at me in the mirror after we hopped out of the shower, and noted that I was definitely looking slimmer; looking at my [progress side by side](http://imgur.com/a/gcFuQnZ), I'm inclined to believe him!

To be honest, it may even be more than 10 lbs; I switched scales a few weeks ago due to my first scale needing calibrated every single time for accuracy, which jumped me from 185 to 187 when I made the switch. But to keep myself humble, I'm just going off straight numbers and saying I'm 10 lbs down.

keto,mqucyd,klutzosaurus-rex,Progress Report - For Accountability,"SW: 198lbs GW: 130lbs CW: 184lbs

Hello fellow reddit ketoers! Just putting my story out there more for accountability but I will take support too, lol! My goal weight is just a lower number and not what I am holding myself too. I may get there, below there, or be above. For me it is all about how I feel and look to myself, and not the scale number. I found this sub over 4 years ago when I first tried keto. I was 130lbs then, and was just trying to get rid of stubborn extra tummy flab. I got down to 122 and still had it, but that's a whole 'nother post. I did not phase carbs back in, and just started eating like I did prior to keto. Add in stress from a really shitty job, anxiety and depression and you get to me at 170lbs. Then I finally got a new non stressful job and COVID lockdowns happened. We ate out the whole time and maybe cooked 3-4 times. Once we were allowed back at work I was just ordering door dash because I am lazy and it was convenient. That's how we got to me at 198lbs. My boyfriend also gained a lot of weight too, and we both were just done. We decided we would do keto, and we have been on it for about 3 or 4 weeks. To me it is the easiest diet I've ever been on and I can do it without feeling like I am depriving myself. I love that I don't get cravings or hangry anymore and that I have to actually remind myself it's probably time to eat. My only ""complaint"" is that I miss fruit. I am a huge fruit fan. My boyfriend on the other hand is a bread/pasta/rice fanatic so he hates this. He also hates all veggies except potatoes and carrots. But he is sticking with it until he gets where he wants. To him this food is just calories to fuel the body. 

I haven't started exercising yet, but I need too. Mainly for my mental health but I remember my gym routines from 4 years ago and I was just starting to feel strong and see muscles developing, so I want to get back to that feeling. I have chondromalacia (cartilage is coming off the back of my kneecaps) in both knees and a birth defect in my back (spina bifida occulta) that prevent me from doing high impact things, like running. I LOVE running. Of course I love the thing I can't do. UGH. So I suck it up in the gym (like my boyfriend does with food) for other cardio like a bike or elliptical. Anyone else limited in working out? What kind of workouts do you do? I think we will start by just going walking everyday, and I will add things in from there. I hate ""starting over"" in regards to working out because I hate feeling crappy (I am a baby for pain) for the first few weeks. No pain no gain.  


Without exercise being involved I've lost 14lbs and I'm stoked about it. My real problem is patience!!!! i just want to be back at my smaller size and feeling super confident. A pic of me from the previous keto time came up in my timehop today and OMG please gimme dat back!!! I know I will get there, but I need to stay focused on the now.

I hit 1650 days 1 &amp; 2 because I am half way through the insanity workout program, I just added strength training, and I walk a couple of miles most days. I was actually 174 when I started, but gained weight during insanity. I was half-assing my diet, i would do great 3-4 days and then I'd cheat for the rest of the week. I decided keto was a good idea because there's really no room for ""messing up"", which would keep me on top of my diet. The thought of being kicked out of ketosis is enough healthy pressure for me to not give into cravings! I am eating steaks, salmon, chicken, broccoli, yogurt, some cheeses, protein shakes, some bacon, eggs, and that's pretty much it.

This is my first week of keto, I am on day 3. Days 1 &amp; 2 were pretty good, I tried to consume LOTS of fats (only to realize that you don't need actually need that much, it's all about cutting carbs) and I kept my carbs below 22g. I am also being conscious of not going too much on protein! I bought a scale to accurately measure my food so I KNOW what kind of calories and macros I'm getting, which has actually been nice! I was WAY off from my previous guessing.

I've made sure to keep up with my electrolytes, I started taking magnesium and potassium tablets yesterday, and I know I'm getting enough sodium. BUT this morning I felt the symptoms of a hangover. Usually when I drink alcohol, I take magnesium and potassium tablets, eat food, and drink plenty of water before I fall asleep- and usually I feel fine. BUT THIS MORNING I FELT HUNGOVER, even though I've been keeping up with water intake and electrolytes!

ALSO, I've been feeling very anxious, and my awareness has changed. I feel like my world is just off. Like something happened that made my life super different. Then I started to doubt the entire diet. I was like ""is this healthy?"" ""am I putting myself in danger?"" ""I am challenging my body too hard?"". Idk I kept thinking about this as artificial scarcity, I guess there's a lot of fear based stuff in the media about this diet that's making me doubt this whole thing. Has ANYONE gone through this? Is this a good idea?? I need some reassurance and motivation! I don't want to hurt myself.

keto,mqtv8m,Sp0ken4,Arguing Dirty vs Clean Keto is Stupid,"I've been doing Keto for 4 years. I primarily do it for it's anti-inflammatory and low acid properties, along with all the other goodness. One of the coolest things I've seen throughout those four years is local stores packing new low-carb and keto friendly options. It's makes a sustainable keto lifestyle a lot more cost effective and realistic. 

For example, there are literally six different keto breads I can purchase from a number of stores in my neighborhood. There's pasta, keto bakeries, fucking cereal, waffles and all types of new shit. 

And yet there's so much animosity from people staunchly approaching keto with a *eat clean* mindset. As if a function of keto isn't to clean your innards. And sure it's fine, do as you please. What's not fine is dismissing others who have managed to integrate Keto into their life their way.  

There are so many new folks that get railed by asshats that have convinced themselves anything processed is anti keto. And I believe these folks hurt the keto community. 

Personally I think clean/dirty keto is bullshit. Some people have trouble with moderation so they choose a label to help them maintain their goals.

Then I tried a low-cal balanced diet I had a relatively lower weight loss and It was again very difficult to follow this kind of nutrition.

My dream has been to go back under 220lbs (100kg). I was really upset that even though in the past I got the target, I‘d not been able to stay there. I was quite desperate, and I couldn’t control my weight at all, and I reached again and again 260lbs.

One year ago, while I was struggling with my last low-fat/low-cal diet with actual poor results and lot of hardship, I was told about keto and the incredible result you can achieve with it.

I started with keto, and I have to admit, initially it was very difficult. Big difficulties for me was to give up on my beloved pasta and pizza and that’s a real sacrifice considering I’m Italian.

I was almost to give up, when luckily one year ago a friend of mine introduced an Italian brand specialized in low card foods to. They offer pasta, bread, cakes all with very low carb content (around 5gr CHO/100gr). There are also preparations to make pasta, bread, pizza and cakes home. Everything tastes delicious. You wouldn’t be even able to recognize differences with high carb food.

This way I’m now able to eat all my beloved dishes keeping my carbohydrate lower than 25gr a day.

Eating in such a way eventually I hit my target few months ago and I’m going further down. My current weight is 210lbs (95Kg)

I haven’t felt my self so good and energetic since my twenties. I will stay on keto forever. That’s only joy and fun and no sacrifice at all.",2363239,1618395650,2021-04-14 18:20:50,667994,5,1

Then he asked me if I'd be ok with him discontinuing my statin and doing another lipid panel in 6 months to confirm I'm fine without them... before I had a chance to bring it up.

keto,mqjqlp,owlegion,"After 2 weeks on clean keto, processed fast food made me feel disgusted and unsatisfied","I'm writing this post because I thought this might encourage some people to continue on their keto journey. 

Backstory: I used to be 203lbs(5'9 male) back in August, now at 164lbs after tonights cheat meal maybe at 169lbs.  

I do back to back water fasting, and keto on eating days. I eat virtually no sugar on keto not even artificial sugar. It seems like my weight loss had stalled at 164 lbs, so I thought take a break from keto, and eat whatever I wanted to get my leptin levels up. I still ate keto, I just couldn't order anything off of uber eats for some reason. I just craved broccoli, and spinach with a hamburger patty with cheese. So I had that for lunch, and the same meal for dinner. With an organic cookie, half of a brownie, and some chocolate pretzels. 

So an hour ago, I said to myself I need more carbs, so I finally went with something on uber eats. I went with Wendy's. I got some nuggets, fries, and a burger.  BIG MISTAKE. The food tasted so badddddddddddddd, like ewwwwww. My organic burger tasted way better than the wendy's burger. After all these years, I finally know why people say to avoid processed foods.Cause I feel like shit now. I felt like the meal I had was not wholesome at all. Their was no feeling of pleasure while eating the food. 

So don't give up, you may have carb cravings or junk food cravings, and honestly it's not worth it. Stay on keto, and your gut microbiome will crave healthier food.",2363083,1618377025,2021-04-14 13:10:25,686619,2,1

keto,mqilrc,et187,The Problem with Keto,"So a few weeks back a friend and I were discussing Keto and how it works for so many people.  We like everyone else decided to try it.  The 1st week went well, I lost 7lb and my friend lost 8lb (not that we are competing or anything).  So far so good, right? Well into my 3rd week I lost 2lb and my friend gained 5lb.  In the meantime both my brother and my mom got on the kick and the same thing happened to them.  They lost a good amount of weight the 1st 2 weeks and then it slowed down drastically.  After talking with my brother, his friend (in the nutrition field) mentioned a different approach that basically outlined the do's and don't with this kind of diet and set him up with a ""eating"" plan.  Did it work? Yes. Do I have a friend that is willing to set up a personal ""eating"" plan for me? The answer is no.  Do I want to pay someone tons of money to tell me how to eat? Also no. But I did some research and there is tons of it on the internet.  I've been reading the forums, articles, posts, you name it.  Everything I came across had conflicting info.  So the same friend that got me started on this Keto life style found the Keto Resource and the 28 day Keto online.  He swears by it, and he didn't have to pay someone tons of money.  So what did I do? I paid the $37 (it was on sale) and I signed up for the ""challenge"", I figured why not.  Its cheap and if it works, even better.

So I did some research and found some conflicting information. One article said keto can cause it but only at first and that keto actually helps prevent it due to helping inflammation. Another article...  no mention of keto but other health factors. One says avacados are a cause but another it's high fat dairy. Almost all say high intake of meat(chicken, beef, pork), some seafood,  sugary drinks, and alcohol are a cause which blows my mind because I'm not eating high protein or high amounts of dairy.

keto,mnp6mr,stereoeraser,Sustainable Keto (Life after reaching health goals),"I was thinking about the USNews’s poor ranking of the Keto diet, which in my opinion is written based ignorance rather than reality. However, I want to know what other long term keto dieters do in sustaining mode, and maybe give people starting on the diet encouragement to continue. Or is it actually difficult to sustain for the majority?

My own experience on sustaining:

After 2 years of strict keto and reaching my goal body fat and weight, I relaxed the protocol and would treat myself to ice cream (w/real sugar) almost daily (2 scoops &lt;20 g carbs) and do not restrict carbs on the weekends (however, carbs feel so filling now that I can only eat once a day on the weekends).

Blood tests show I’m still always in ketosis. Any weight gained from a weekend of carbs disappears by mid-week and I haven’t had dreams about eating carbs for the last 2 years. In fact, carbs make me feel so full so quickly that I tend to avoid any old carbs and only eat carbs I really love like ice cream and French fries.

About 6 months ago, I started to drink decaffeinated tea in the mornings. About 3 months ago, I started drinking it after dinner as well. After eating my meal, which always included an erythritol laden dessert, and then drinking tea, the inside of my mouth would start breaking out in these ulcers/hives. They would literally be all over the inside of my mouth, and sometimes on my tongue. It took me a bit to understand what was actually causing it. It only happens if I drink tea after my meals. If I drink tea after my meal without having any erythritol, no reaction either. 

I also tried different kinds of decaffeinated teas, as I know some use chemicals in the process of decaffeination, but it seems not to matter what type I use, I still get the reaction.

Examples: The far eastern civilizations were built on rice, the Roman empire and the civilizations in the fertile crescent were built on wheat and barley; The mesoamerican civilizations, that is the Aztecs and the Mayans etc., were built on corn, and potatoes. It was grains, and the farmers that grew them, that allowed the civilizations to produce enough calories that they didn't have to be hunter-gatherers all the time, and could therefore build on their arts and sciences.

I have more energy and feel more alert, and slightly lighter on my feet (though that may well just be placebo effect). However, I have one major problem, and that is with the hunger pangs.

I can deal with carb cravings, and wanting pizza or pasta or chips or what have you, but since I started keto I am always hungry (for anything, meat and veggies seem just as appealing as carbs). I can and will eat 4 chicken breasts with a half bag of sauteed spinach and a big hunk of cheese, and 20 minutes later still be hungry. I have been drinking plenty of water and minding my electrolytes, and easily meeting my macros. I am 5'8"" and 150 lbs, and have a decent appetite normally, but this is unbearable.

I'm carefully monitoring foods and electrolytes. I also monitor my ketones and glucose.

I'm not on keto for weightloss, and I know that this sub mostly uses it for weightloss instead of medically--but wondered if anyone out there could give me some insight since this sub is bigger than the medical keto one.

I know there is a time period it takes to get ""fat-adapted,"" and that may be the time when improvement starts, but I expected if it worked for me, I would have seen improvement sooner.
I don't think I'm fat adapted yet because I'm still very tired (yes my electrolytes and calories are good).

Is it still too soon to throw in the towel? Or did most of you see improvement before the 1 month mark?

I did very strict keto a few years ago when life wasn't so challenging, and I found it easy.

Newbie here and lately I have been ravenous for fresh vegetables. Not refined carbs, not sugar - but veggie after veggie. I feel as though I can eat a bucket full. I'm thinking this craving is coming from a deficiency? Not sure. 

I'm monitoring my calories every day (aiming for 1200) and thinking perhaps I'm going too low while my body is being fat adapted and that could be it. I'm 5 11, female, 27 years old, CW: 174 GW: 150. My challenge I guess is that too much meat doesn't feel good for my body, and so trying to hit my calories with tofu and fish and only occasional servings of meat is tough. 

Well anyway today, I've gone up to 25 grams of carbs when my goal has been to stay under 18. The carbs themselves we're extra avocado, pepper and spinach. 

I know that all carbs function differently in the body, do you think I will be kicked out of ketosis from these veggie carbs? And what are these intense cravings? 

I'm loving keto for the weight loss but I don't know how much longer I can stay at under 18 grams of carbs per day if I can't enjoy more vegetables.",2358856,1617931434,2021-04-09 09:23:54,1132210,21,1

The recipe seems to make as much noodles as the JFC brand bag and the size of the homemade noodles are similar as well.

I could reduce how much I eat by half and make it fit my macros but there is such a big difference in carbs, and at least with the JFC brand noodles I would know that I will stay under 5g carbs for ketosis.

I had been doing OMAD keto (lazy just counting carbs) for a few months when I started to get some aching pains in my feet and knees, as well as had a couple nights where I had pretty bad leg cramps. I didn't really pay much attention and actually thought I was dehydrated so I started drinking more water on a regular basis. I think this was a mistake, because over time the pain got slightly worse, and one day I actually ended up having my vision go blurry very suddenly and I developed an absolutely horrible headache that hospitalized me (I've never had headaches like this one, could definitely be classified as a migrane as it was absolutely unbearable). Those of you with more keto experience probably already know what happened.

They ran tests and everything looked normal. I did however have potassium on the low end of normal as well as sodium and magnesium were in the lower end. I did some more research (which I should have done in the first place), and it became very clear that I was not consuming enough electrolytes.

I am starting to think supplementing electrolytes during long term keto is something that should really be pushed as a necessity for newcomers. I do wonder how many people end up writing off this diet because they had an experience like mine.

Since the event I have been supplementing 400mg of potassium and magnesium, and 1000mg of sodium per day. Since I started I gave felt all around much better both mentally and physically while in ketosis.

TLDR: I wasn't supplementing electrolytes on OMAD keto, and I ended up being hospitalized with the most painful headache I've ever had. Supplementing has fixed my issue and made me feel better.",2358687,1617915020,2021-04-09 04:50:20,1148624,18,1

I’ve been on keto for almost a month and a half. Since changing my eating habits, most of my stomach upsets have gone away, which has been awesome! However, today something awful happened. I was sitting at a coffee shop and I had diarrhea. No big deal, I just went to the bathroom and did my thing. When I walked out of the bathroom and sat back down, I experienced what I can only compare to labor pains. I’ve never given birth, but in my mind this is what I think labor pains would feel like. I had extremely painful cramps in somewhat of a V shape on my belly and my uterus area hurt so insanely bad. I damn near considered calling an ambulance because I didn’t know how the hell I was gonna make it out of there. I sat down for a few minutes and just calmed myself down. I gathered my belongings and left. I walked to my car and drove home with tears streaming down my face. My belly felt so tight and my cramps down there were something fierce. I got home and getting inside sucked too. I live on the second floor, I don’t even know how I made it up the stairs.

I even get in about 12,000 to 15,000 steps a night at my job and I still get no results. I don't understand why out of nowhere, my body isn't making any progress. My goal is 220lbs, so I can go skydiving in the summer and it really bums me out that I'm so close to the finish line and I've hit a brick wall.

keto,mmvzcd,harounnn,Tips for Ketogenic Diet,"1. Drink water before and after meals to suppress hunger and make you feel fuller  

2. Stay hydrated, it's just healthy and helps any form of weight loss.  

3. Get some exercise in, nothing crazy. 30 minutes of walking is all you need, maybe 3-7 times a day. Exercising is not required for weight loss in keto diet.  

4. Try to eat as far into the day as possible so you don't end up eating too often.   

5. Limit how many meals you eat a day to avoid feeling. On a keto diet, you shouldn't feel hungry very often because your body is in ketosis, so take advantage of that to decrease caloric intake. Make sure to diversify your foods and get some veggies in to get proper nutrition.  

6. Avoid environments where non-keto foods are available. This is obvious but very important. If, for example, your family is eating cookies in the kitchen, stay in your room doing something else  

7. Keep in mind that the beginning of starting a keto diet is the hardest, then your cravings will go away and so is your appetite.   

8. You can still overeat on keto. No matter what diet or exercise plan you're on, if you're overeating, you'll see less results. Make sure that you're eating slowly and not having big proportions.  

9. Best to limit yourself up to 20 carbs. It's a limit, not a goal, you don't have to try to hit 20 carbs. Realize that this is the recommended maximum to guarantee ketosis. 

10. If you mess up, it's okay. I didn't stick to the keto diet on my first try. You have so many more times to try again. Forgive yourself, realize you can't change the past, and move on.",2358516,1617900588,2021-04-09 00:49:48,1163056,23,1
keto,mmv8vu,MastryGG,Made new lifestyle changes and wondering if what I eat would be considered Keto?,"[Food](https://i.gyazo.com/fa3d787b5b239e8182bb05c2bf86b350.png)

So in March after losing out on GME (And a lot of research into carbs and sugar documentary and more etc but that's less dramatic) I decided to completely change my lifestyle and started a 1 week fast and then slowly moved to a 22 hours Intermittent fasting, slowly adding healthy foods.

Then after a bit, I started swapping stuff around then adding exercise, I decided to add a salad to the diet and experimented with eating times, now eating 2:10 pm Salad wise and 6:30-7 pm during the main meal (I eat the walnuts and dark chocolate right after dinner, so I count it as a main meal) time which I assume would count as a 6-hour eating window even though I only eat twice.

Though I can feel the difference from extremely unhealthy junk food and Irn Bru (fizzy drinks) every day to this diet, I lost about 15-18kg from the fast alone, though I plateaued a bit from then as I stayed at 120kg for 2 weeks, this could be from countless of things and I also started to do 1 hour walks every day in the morning and pushed my waking up time to 6:15 AM, so hopefully that speeds up the system health and metabolic wise",2358490,1617898507,2021-04-09 00:15:07,1165137,6,1

I followed my Macros but have over the last 3.5 weeks gone super strict, this has included not drinking any alcohol this saw maybe 1.5kg.   
Daily meals are usually:  
Breakfast   3 egg and spinach omelette with some cheese,  
lunch tuna or chicken with mayo and lettuce,   
Dinner steak and broccoli or asparagus or chicken with spinach and feta salad.   
Snacks are usually cheese, a few almonds or raspberries.   
Carbs are never more than 22grams per day usually less, everything is weighed. I drink water or herbal teas with the odd coffee with double cream  


I train weightlifting 4x per week (back, legs, chest, shoulders) coupled with 1-2 5km runs per week and 2x 20km bike rides.

keto,mmoes3,mshhh,Threw up (possibly) from exogenous ketones and coffee during IF,"I know exogenous ketones isn’t necessary (at all) for keto, but curiosity got the best of me and I had to try it. I especially wanted to see how they worked during a fast.

I’ve been trying them twice a day (pill form. The package says to take two) for the past 4 days. With meals I’ve had no issues, but the past two mornings I’ve taken them on an empty stomach because of intermittent fasting, followed with my usual coffee right after. About an hour later I felt sudden discomfort and had to vomit urgently. This happened in the exact same way and timeframe both mornings. After vomiting I felt fine. Coffee a few hours later, still no food, was also ok.

I’ve been doing IF and some 36hr fasts for the past 1,5 months with absolutely no issues, and coffee on an empty stomach has been just fine. Absolutely no discomfort or anything. 

So I’m assuming the ketones have something to do with it. Could it be the combination with coffee? Combination of minerals/vitamins (I’m also taking multivitamins, magnesium, and extra iron because I donated blood last week. But also no problems with these alone, with coffee)?

I love the IF lifestyle, and don’t want to give up on the ketones just yet. I at least want to try a longer fast first.

Does anyone have a remotely similar experience, or just know in general what the issue could be? Should I only take them during longer fasts, drop the morning coffee, or take the two pills during my eating window?

I have energy to do things with my children,” Kendra says.","Can a keto diet help you lose 100 pounds (45 kilos), boost your energy levels, and gain an interest in exercising? Yes! All these things happened to Kendra thanks to the low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet.

*“I’m closer than ever to my goal weight! I have energy to do things with my children,”* Kendra says.

Here’s Kendra’s inspiring story, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

## Kendra’s keto journey

My name is Kendra, I’m 32 years old, and I live in the US Midwest.

﻿I started following the keto diet in April 2018. Since then, I’ve lost over 100 pounds (45 kilos)!

Initially, it wasn’t easy. I used to overdo it on snacks, sweets, and fast food. My portion sizes were out of control.

I realized that not only was I setting *myself* up for health issues, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure that run in my family, but I was setting *my children* up for the same.

I decided enough was enough. A friend told me about the keto diet and the success she was having, and I started the next day.

These days, I cook at home and we rarely eat out. I’ve learned how to cook a variety of healthy and delicious meals. I can make just about any dish keto-friendly. I’ve also incorporated intermittent fasting. On most days, my eating window is 12 pm to 8 pm, and at least one day a week I do ‘one meal a day’ .

Of course, there have been times when I’ve eaten high-carb foods, but eating these foods only made me realize that my body just doesn’t agree with them. Low carb is what works best for me.

keto,mmjpke,potato_handshake,Consistently Feeling Like Ass,"So I quit a 15 year drinking habit on April 18th of last year. This is something I never thought I'd be able to say. Though I feel quite happy with this accomplishment, I'm overwhelmed with the feeling of hopelessness, and I fear that I will never consistently feel good/healthy; because despite my cessation of alcohol consumption, I'm still waking up multiple days a week feeling hungover. What does this have to do with keto?? Well. Just stick with me here. 

Several months ago, I also decided to quit a detrimental sugar addiction that developed after I quit alcohol. This is when I decided to make the change to the ketogenic WOE. (I did keto 3 years ago and really enjoyed how full of life it made me, so I wanted to return to it.) 

So I've been making a lot of adjustments to try to better myself, but I keep having strings of bad days where lethargy overcomes my body (especially since starting keto this time around.) I can go several days feeling so energetic and productive, beaming with health and stamina; but then come the series of days where my body feels like one big heavy brick, and getting out of bed feels like a feat. 

Well, I had an epiphany yesterday that maybe, just maybe the hangover feeling and overall lethargy have something to do with an electrolyte imbalance and dehydration? So I did a lot of reading and came to the conclusion that I need to start supplementing electrolytes. I mixed up a lovely ketoade yesterday morning and happily gulped that salty concoction down. And ya know what?? Yesterday was great! I had energy, my brain wasn't foggy, and I was happy! I thought, ""Wow! What an easy fix to an issue that has been plaguing me for months!""

And then I woke up today feeling like shit again. Even after consuming a few ketoades. 

I know I'm being verbose, but I just wanted to give a little bit of background so you all could maybe help me out.

Maybe I just wanted to vent. I'm exhausted, and I don't know what else to try.",2358036,1617855048,2021-04-08 12:10:48,1208596,8,1

Me and the wife were doing keto for about two months consistently in preparation of her getting pregnant again (she wanted to get rid of the excess pounds following our first kid, the plan is to go off keto fully for about a month prior to getting pregnant to ensure nutrient levels are fine. I understand people do pregnant keto but not planning for that at the moment).

After about two months, she was having trouble staying with it without cheat days. She had been making some new Indian friends and doesn't want to be the weird person who can't eat their very carb-heavy food with them.

Basically our strategy has been to cheat either one or both weekend days depending on social plans, sometimes only for a single meal a day and sometimes more substantially, and then do a 32-hour zero calorie fast from Sunday night to Tuesday morning for the autophagy to try and reset the keto.

Does anyone know if this is hard on the system or if we'd really be getting much of the keto benefits from doing this?

Preliminary thanks for your help.

I started keto last Monday, sub 20g carbs and meticulously tracking my electrolytes per the FAQ, and I just have a couple questions.

So the first 5 or so days I actually felt great, increased energy and clearer cognition, which is what I’m hoping keto can help me with, but after that I’ve begun to feel sluggish and just a little ... off. I don’t feel awful, it isn’t keto flu, I just feel a little lesser than. I searched around and found that almost every question like this ends up being answered by the deafening roar of everyone saying: ELECTROLYTES. 

So, to head that off, I promise you, I’ve been supplementing and tracking my electrolytes.

So my question is: At what point should I begin to consistently feel the benefits from keto (energy, cognition, etc.)? I’m on day 9 and feeling generally meh, but I’m willing to wait it out if that’s necessary. But I do wonder about the timeline, and possibly some tips on how to optimize my diet for therapeutic benefits.

keto,mm6rjh,LemonPitiful3228,2 months in. Dizzy and weak.," I started keto about 2 months ago and went in head first.  Apart from big salads and veggies, I cut out all other carbs.  I also did intermittent fasting right away.   
  At first it all seemed fine.  I hit the keto flu right on schedule and by week 2 I seemed to be ok.  Week 3 was even better.      
  Then my neighbor gave me 3 small cookies.  I decided I'd just have one a day, since they were only about 25 carbs each.  By the 3rd day I started to feel weak and dizzy.  So I realized that wasn't a good idea.      
  It took me over a week to stop feeling so lousy and tired after that but I started to recover.   
  Then in the line at Trader Joes I saw some “sugarless” mints so I bought some and munched on them on the way home in the car.  They were so incredibly sweet I can't believe they were sugar free.  Maybe Stevia?   
  In any case, 3 days later I had that same dizziness and fatigue.   
  That was almost a week ago and I'm still having these intermittent bouts of extreme fatigue and dizziness.      
  I'm a guy whos been working out 5 days a week for years and now I can barely make it up the stairs without being out of breath.  My heart rate is constantly way up around 90 even when I'm resting.   
  I've been taking lots of supplements including mag and potassium and I'm trying to salt everything on TOP of already sodium rich foods....   
  my hands always get that “pruney” look though and I don't get it.  I've been trying to drink lots of water and salt but how much does a person really need??   
  I'm starting to worry.  I've never felt like this before.  I'm at a loss and while I'd like to get to the “other side”, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.  I have a lot of work to do and I don't have much time for this.   
  Anyone who wants to talk me out of ditching this lifestyle, please feel free.",2357555,1617815148,2021-04-08 01:05:48,1248496,19,1
keto,mm6j5y,cmcarman,Low blood sugar suspected,"I am a 36M, 6’2”, 250lbs. I have been on keto for about 3.5 weeks now and posted recently in keto beginners about being frustrated due to lack of weight loss and fatigue. Well many of the helpful people suggested I count my calories. 

Based on the calculator in the side bar for a 20% deficit, my fat should be 133g, protein should be 138g, my net carbs at 29g, and my overall calories around 1860. 

I’ve been using premium version of my fitness pal and tracking everything, including my keto electrolyte supplement drink I’ve been taking a few times a day. I’ve been watching my sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels and hitting my macros right on. 

However very recently (last few days) I’ve been having multiple issues where I’m light headed, faint, dizzy, have tingling and even some cases twitching (usually late at night) in my limbs. I initially suspected keto flu but it’s more than that. So I got a blood glucose meter and checked my blood levels and I was around 70mg/dL within 1 hour of eating a 750 calorie breakfast consisting of eggs, cream, cheese, avocado, sausage, spinach, kale, and coconut milk. I continued to monitor through the day the next few days when I’d feel like this and every time my blood sugar was around or below 70mg/dL. 

I have a doctors appointment Monday to see if something else is going on causing the lower blood sugar.

I've been on keto for about 4 months now, less than 20/30g of carbs per day. In a few weeks there will be an event which will probably lead to a meal (probably two) and I was planning to have a cheat meal during that. After reading this I'm not entirely sure tho, might have to break keto slowly and then go back in. Please don't start ""You can attend that event and still eating keto"".

Hello! 

I am new to keto &amp; reddit. I started keto about a week ago. I believe that I am in ketosis (went through a period of exhaustion, peeing a lot, weird taste in mouth, etc.). A lot of the negative symptoms are now gone. I feel way less bloated now which is great.

My question for now is will things like Rebel ice cream &amp; diet soda slow down my progress ? I attempted Keto in the past and lost 13 pounds in one week. However, I was pretty strict then. I gave in on day 8.

Fast forward 6 months later and I weigh 30 pounds more. I want a diet that is sustainable. However, I don’t want diet soda or rebel to slow down my progress. I am not proud of it but I have probably ate 4 pints in my first week. Additionally, I have been having between 2-5 diet sodas a day. I know I should cut back. My cravings do not feel as strong now so hopefully I can.

Does anyone have any input, advice, thoughts, or information they can share with me to help? 

I would like to lose 80 pounds by December. I’m sincerely willing to do what it takes - open to learning!

keto,mlym6j,bbjimin,What do you typically eat?,"Hey. I used to do 23-1 IF and keto and had great results while working a labour intensive job. This was a couple years ago by now and I'm considering getting back into keto again (just started IF again)    

I was looking for meal suggestions though because I really like to keep things simple.   

When I was doing 23-1, I was eating 1 omelette a day and that was my meal. It was 3-4 eggs, 0.5-1lb of lean ground beef with some vegetables and hotsauce and that was basically it. Though I'm less active now (not doing 40 hours of labor a week) so I'm not sure if 3\~ eggs a day is the greatest idea with all the saturated fat but maybe it's not an issue at all.     

I never felt weak on that diet. There were days at work where I was hungry by lunch which kinda sucked but I never felt exhausted, lightheaded or anything like that and did this diet for months.  

So what are your favourite meals? Do you take vitamin/electrolyte supplements? By chance do you know if my omelette strategy meets all/most of the recommended intakes?   

I'm considering keto again mostly because even veggie-packed dishes that are supposed to keep me full just don't. Example: I literally just finished a 36 hour fast like 3 hours ago. I broke it by eating half a pineapple and then half an hour later had a banana and some oatmeal. That is already 500 calories and a decent amount of food but an hour later I was still hungry. I decided I'd make a stirfry. I used like 1/4 grated cauliflower instead of rice, a piece of haddock, cucumber, carrots, broccoli and black beans. Ate a full, average size bowl of that and an hour later I could go eat the rest. That was probably another 3-500 calories so in 3 hours I consumed 1000\~ ""healthy"" calories and I'm still hungry -- the day hasn't even started.",2357257,1617789118,2021-04-07 17:51:58,1274526,10,1

keto,mlx4o8,Roedsten,Any Restart Keto pointers ?....,"(I posted similar 2 days ago but somehow disappeared)

Keto for March - strict adherence except early on when I misunderstood some key ideas and didnt have macros correct. End of March here was Easter last week and in Denmark thats a 5 day long weekend with lots of visits and visiting, so I just relaxed for 5 days. Restarted on Monday with 1551kcal, 154P/20C/95F along with intermittent fasting 16/8. My weight fluctuates so much that its hard to say if I really gained weight back but for sure beer, candy and pasta were on the menu. Not worried about it. I ran for 45 minutes yesterday - felt strong so for sure glycogen stores available. Plan to run again today - maybe a bit longer - to burn out my legs - then do a 24 hour fast. 

Sound like a plan? 

Postnote: Enjoyed the pasta and goodies but had a decent amount of unexpected guilt surrounding this. I mention because I think many would agree - in the course of a year - there will be times where its just very practical to suspend the strictness. I know I want to continue with the macros etc. for a few reasons (I feel better for one!), but learning how to navigate these schedules is a good skill. That month of being strict got easier and easier, then now, restarting, is second-nature almost. I think that will become the norm for me. Any changing of macros and kcal will be a function of targeted carbs etc., once other workouts are introduced after the lockdown is over.

keto,mlwdk5,giant-fag,Confession of a food scientist,"  TLDR – Junk food scientist that doesn’t eat junk food.

..

I am a food scientist, working in one of the largest food ingredients company in the world. Most of the time, I worked with major (and minor) food manufacturers for colas and beverages, crackers and cookies, snacks, sauces, instant meals, breads, sausages… you named it. 

How to I make them delicious? Through scientific manipulation of flavours and textures.

How to I make them cost as cheap as possible for profits? Using the cheapest fillers (think gums,  starch/modified starch, air, water, palm oil, sugar, syrups), combination of above while maintaining the longest possible shelf life.

My job is to create the most delicious, addictive and profitable wonders.

Now, why the confession? Because, personally I avoid these like plagues… I do not consume what I create. The only exception where I ‘eat’ my creations were duration product presentation and tasting sessions with my customers (I.e. food manufacturers), and secretly spit out on a tissue, unseen. 

..

I came from Singapore, where we pride ourselves as food paradise. And as with most Asian families, my ‘old’ home diet were largely filled with carbohydrates – rice, noodles, and mixing in the modern fast foods and snacks. We were fat, very fat. I WERE fat. We embraced low fat diet think that would save us. Thanks America,  your SAD and my government.

Likewise, when I was in University (late 2000s), low fat is (and still) encouraged in our product development and nutrition modules. Incidentally, I took biochemistry as well, and was some credits away to be a dietitian, if I want to.

At that time, the fat me was looking ways to slim down – which I manage to via CICO, but became skinny fat and bouncing back to fat. In combination of curiosity, frustration and google – I found The Warrior’s Diet by Ori Hofmekler, which then I fell into the rabbits’ hole of paleo, low-carb, keto, The Bitter Truth of Sugar (great video), Ancel Keys (fuck you), and Pure, White and Deadly (great book), along with countless literatures that are eyeopeners and equally suspicious. 

I. was. Mindblown.

Things I learn in school about nutrition were wrong.

I still remember the yelling from my mum and the ‘WTF’ look of acquaintances when I started the journey of keto.

10 years later, I am in and maintaining my greatest shape of my life – visible abs, strong and energetic, I looked good, in fact easily passed 5-8 years younger of my current age. My (2 years ago) last blood test has 265 mg/dL total cholesterol, HDL of 66 mg/dL, LDL of 145 mg/dL, Triglycerides of 31 mg/dL. No V-LDL readings available but I am extremely happy with my triglycerides. My testosterone level shot up too. Doc told me to take statin lol.

My mum? She lost 30kg, very happy and look much younger than her peers too. I am happy that she listened to me.

However, after all these, I still unable to convinced my dad and close friends. So I just keeping to myself now, to reddit, and to friends that need help and listens.

I am glad to take this journey, and will continue doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. my daily foods generally are – blended 2x chicken breast (thanks vitamix), 5-7 whole eggs and big bunch of greens. My rotation of fatty meats are pork belly (uncured bacon), salmons, sardines, beef, etc. Marco – 160-180g of protein as an aim. I do not measure my fats.

keto,mlv0t6,TwiztidOn3,Don't give up!,"Just wanted to share a bit about my journey. I have posted a picture of me at my Daughter's birthday party in October of last year and a picture of me present day. I have tried multiple different diets, pills, drinks, bars, and just about everything else you could think of. One of my closest friends was nearly 400lbs when his Dr. told him that his life was in danger and he needed to make a change. He researched the Keto diet and started it. I was amazed at his results. After seeing myself in those pictures at my Daughters bday, I decided to give it a try. At first I felt stupid for trying another diet that would most assuredly fail. I felt like an idiot eating my hotdogs and burgers without buns, I felt like a girly man switching from IPA beer, to no carb seltzers. I missed gorging myself in pastas and bread, and doughnuts (oh my god..the doughnuts!), but I told myself I would give it an honest try for a week and see what happens. I weighed in at the end of that week and had lost 4lbs, it was full speed ahead from there. The real reason I wanted to make this post is because there were multiple times in the last 7 months that I was stuck at one weight range and thought I would never lose anymore, it frustrated the HELL out of me, but I stuck to it, you have to stick to it! At one point it took me an entire month to get from 247 to 245. I started a 20 minute HIT workout on my rowing machine, 3 times a week and went fully religious on the Keto diet. I gave myself a goal to get to 230lbs (because that is the weight that google told me I would no longer be obese at my height lol). In the picture at my daughter's party I was 283lbs, today I weighed in at 231. If you are stuck and you are frustrated, I came here today to say...DON'T STOP! Get more physical, drink more water. YOU CAN DO THIS!

keto,mlsggs,ohn_jay,About to pull the trigger on keto! Little bio and questions!,"Hello everyone, I'm really excited to start this new lifestyle! I'm not drawn to this so much for weight loss, my weight is more or less stable. What really brought me to keto was going on whole 30 with my fianceé last year and then connecting some dots.

So, I'm diagnosed with Graves' Disease (AI thyroid disorder) and pretty much had it for as long as I can remember. I didn't get diagnosed til I was in my early twenties. A little under a decade later, and at the time of undergoing whole 30, I went to get some lab work done. My Endo tells me that my Graves' was entirely gone. WHAT?! I couldn't put a finger as to what happened due to other stressors going on at the time. Fast forward to about a month ago and I've gone down the rabbit hole of ketogenesis. All of the benefits from weight loss, boosts of energy, to possible reversal of some horrible illnesses. A light bulb had finally turned on and I gathered that my illness went into remission because I cut all the grains and sugar (although I still ate potatoes that I'd cook). This was such a wild occurrence, I couldn't stop thinking about finally making the jump myself.

I know I'm going to be starting with simple dishes. Eggs/bacon, salads with oil dressings, burger bowls, bone broth. I'm trying to figure out how to fit Japanese cuisines into this as well, it is my homeland, after all. One question I've had is what to do for the tare (broth seasoning). Idk if I can get past the shirataki noodles, so I may opt out of noodle options entirely. Eggs/veggies/meats will be easy enough, but the seasoning is difficult to put a finger to.

Does everyone in here regularly go to farmer's markets and butchers? I don't want to break the bank too much but I know I want as much lasting impact as possible. I've also thought ahead to get lite salt and mio flavoring for ""ketoade"" to fight the keto flu. I'm definitely starting with 1/8 teaspoon of salt to make sure I'm not overdoing anything. I'm really excited to see where this takes me - if I could rid my anxiety, hand tremors, fast heart rate, or to just generally feel really good.

After wrestling with alcoholism for over a decade and a half, I decided it was time to stop the cycle before I turned 30. In that time I had an incredibly complex and unhealthy relationship with food. I was always overweight, but was able to maintain a active lifestyle participating in sports year-round. After moving to the big city for work when I was 26, I began a sedentary lifestyle and drank over a 5th of alcohol 4-7 days a week for 4 years, and gained 100lbs in the process.

This isn’t a sobriety sub so I’ll skip to Keto. 6 months into sobriety, I began strictly monitoring my nutrition using Carb Manager and a food-scale. After 2 weeks of tweaking my diet, I finally started seeing the pounds melt off. I’m under 400lbs for the first time in 3 years, with a goal weight of 260. I am 6’3’’, and haven’t been under 300lbs since I was 5 inches shorter and 15 years younger. Realizing nutrition was a part of life and not just a short term diet made the whole process much easier and less daunting.

keto,mlqrc7,Bitwix,Any other T1D's sick of other T1D's being anti-keto?,"I am a t1d of almost 18 years with a normal a1c.  I acheived this through low carb.  When you're diagnosed, they tell you to keep your a1c as low as possible to ""decrease the risk of complications.""  Decrease, but not eliminate.  People who have ""well controlled"" diabetes still get complications, and it happens often.  

I am in a few groups for diabetes on different social media platforms.  I occasionally leave comments on posts mentioning that I have a normal a1c, and people occasionally inquire about it, so I talk to them.  I was recently talking to the mother of a 6 year old who was diagnosed at the end of last year.  She asked how I got to a normal a1c, so I explained.  After a while she started asking if I ate normally on vacation.  I told her no, because my basal rates and carb ratios are all programmed for low carb, so I'd go through the roof if I started eating carbs again, and on top of that, if I'm on vacation, I definitely don't want to risk ruining my day with roller coaster blood sugars.  Her response was that she wanted her daughter to be ""normal"" and not live with so many ""restrictions"".  I was left scratching my head.  Having food restrictions is FAR from unusual in this day and age.  And furthermore, isn't going blind, having your feet amputated and being on dialysis MORE restrictive than not eating a candy bar?  

I've also been told that the keto diet is ""dangerous"" and ""unhealthy"".  And a whole bunch of other things.  I just don't understand how people can argue against keto, the results of which can clearly be seen, and then turn around and wonder why their blood sugar is 400+ and they don't feel well.",2356963,1617757911,2021-04-07 09:11:51,1305733,18,1

keto,mlpfyc,Stern787,Terrible carb crash,"For background: i started keto after bulking from 182 to 209 over the course of 6 months or so. I lift weights everyday with pretty intense training sessions.

I had done keto in the past and the first week I’d feel foggy/lack of focus had some slight vision issues which made driving difficult (I’d stop to turn, look left, then right and completely forget what the left side looked like). But it would fade after the first week.

This time i went from 209 to 197 in 9 days (started incorporated light cardio at the end of my lifts as well). I felt exactly how i expected to feel, foggy etc. but after about 16 days of it i never got out of the carb crash and mental fogginess. Simple mental math became almost impossible. In the gym i felt great energy wise but i lost about 10-12% of strength on all of my one rep Max’s in the bench, squat and deadlift which didn’t happen the last time i did no carb keto, in fact last time i did keto i was making new person records in the gym. My bench went from 300 to 270 for example. 

I started eating carbs again with each meal but a much reduced amount than i used to. For example half a bagel with my breakfast instead of 2 whole bagels with my chicken, Turkey bacon and veggie breakfast. 

I had to start eating carbs again to get my mental performance back, my ability to do mental math at work and safely operate my car are much more important than getting a little extra shredded quicker.

Did i do something wrong?

I'm super apprehensive because I already feel like I'm kind of plateauing. I've only dropped 1 lb in the past week and I'm worried that if I incorporate more carbs I'll only gain weight. I currently only consume, on average, 10-ish carbs a day. Sometimes more (20 max), sometimes less (at least 5).

I've thought about portioning a can of low sodium black beans to eat over a week, and only adding a tablespoon or two of black beans to one of my meals a day, which would be 2g of carbs per tablespoon.

I tried using fresh mozarella balls but it turned out nightmarishly. So I tried ready grated and it was perfect! Consistency of the things I'm making instantly improved. I realise this is due to water content.

HOWEVER after indulging in a fathead pizza tonight I realised while logging my meals for the day that the pre grated stuff contains a lot more carbs (3.9g in my dinner!) I assume because of flour used to dry it out.

Thankfully after logging my day I came in at 18g so still keto, but it was close and I was trying hard to follow keto recipes, had a light snack for lunch because I knew I was having the pizza for dinner and haven't eaten between meals today. I was shocked at how easily I had come so close to being out of keto (and wonder how often this happens or if indeed I am even in ketosis because maybe I havent been looking closely enough!)

keto,mlinfx,Seanbrody,Canned fish in olive oil - nutrition advice,"I'm eating canned fish in olive oil in a salad at lunch everyday.

I either get the King Oscar sardines or mackerel in olive oil. I keep the olive oil in there, as it's fat and I hate to waste good nutritional food. And I want to vary the fats I'm eating.  


The problem is that when I do my macros on cronometer, or search the internet, the only nutritional values are for a *drained can*.   
*80g can drained - 240 calories*  
The net weight of the can (with oil) is 115g, so another   
*35g of olive oil - 310 calories*  
This is putting me at *550 calories for a can*\- which is what it is I suppose.  
But is this how y'all are figuring it? Or do most people drain the oil?  


I have been cheating and entering the gram value for the can at 115, which outputs at only 345 calories. But who am I kidding really?  


I apologise if this has been asked before, but I have searched the subbreddit and cannot find an an answer

keto,mli7ze,SoggyMeaning,Keto Tips for beginners,"Hi new to this group but have been doing keto for 2 months now and it has really changed my life. I’m 2 months in and 29 lbs down. My confidence has increased dramatically and I was surprised out how stable my moods been. No more mood swings or days where I’ve felt unhappy for no reason whatsoever. 
At first I found it hard due to me being a big snacker and worst of all snacking on carb heavy foods like sandwiches. Anything that’s easy to grab basically. But once you figure out what foods you can have and what foods to avoid it’s actually very easy to adjust your lifestyle to implement keto.

My advice to anyone new is to do your research. The FAQ has a lot of great info on keto and it’s laid out in a way that’s easy for beginners to understand. Another page I found https://sites.google.com/view/ketodietfactsonline/home is very good aswell. Quick and to the point which is how I like to live my life! No big long article to read just info summarised to help you. I also signed up for the keto meal plan they have on the website but it definitely isn’t necessary. It just helped me because I’m very busy and work 55 hours a week so it saved me time in trying to think of recipes to make and all that jazz. It definitely worked anyway so if anyone’s busy it’s a very good plan to follow

The main thing to remember is keto works! Summers just around the corner but with keto you can have the body of your dreams by then! It can be tough but just think of the results!
Let me know what all of your experiences have been like I Love hearing a good success story.",2356676,1617733501,2021-04-07 02:25:01,1330143,3,1

My diet has been pretty consistent for the past several weeks since I started tracking all this. My fasting blood glucose (BG) has been low 90s (mg/dL) to low 100s and are typically between 110 and 120 2-hours after a meal.

Every now and then, I'll get a postprandial BG reading that's between 15 to 20 mg/dL higher than usual. It's not necessarily because of what I've eaten. As I said, I've been eating pretty consistently--I'll just rotate through some group of foods over and over. So this just means that for whatever reason, the same low carb meal that I typically eat will cause my BG to increase.

When this happens, almost without fail, my weight the following morning will be between 0.6 and a full pound lower than the previous morning. 

I'm not sure if the higher BG is causing me to piss more or something, but there seems to be a correlation.

keto,ml7khz,lee97-,Is stevia as healthy as they say? And why I’m going aspartame free for life!,"So I came across this factoid. Aspartame, a very common sweetener, it’s in just about every diet soft drink there is. When it’s warmed and cooled it converts to formaldehyde! If you don’t know what that is, is a chemical uses to preserve corpses, it’s extremely carcinogenic (causes cancer). And it’s not necessarily boiling it, it can be the natural warming and cooling patterns in your house, it’s slower but is still happening. 

I’ve researched stevia as I found some reasonably priced drinks with it, including coca cola. If you look up aspartame, the formaldehyde thing isn’t readily out there. The person I found it out from  know a lot about chemistry and can’t reach them right now. Anyone with knowledge of sweeteners know if there’s hidden health effects of stevia?",2356289,1617700546,2021-04-06 17:15:46,1363098,6,1

I had previously had success with keto a year or so ago. I decided to come off it as I was working out so hard and plateaued. I lost roughly 70 lbs. 

Skip ahead, and I ended up extremely sick last summer and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I could no longer exercise like before and depression hit so hard! The only way I know to cope is eating, which caused me to gain back 20-25 lbs. 

My doc states keto should be my diet of choice in regards to the Lyme disease for as long as I have symptoms (possibly forever). I find myself dreading the idea and also not trusting myself to follow through without using food (especially carbs!) as my drug of choice. I am also struggling to find low intensity workouts due to knee and joint pain.

keto,mkwpqf,Dorpz,How bad is it to not calculate things? Seems to be working,"I have been avoiding carbohydrates for one week now, resulting in me losing 7lbs. 


I'm well aware a good fraction of that will be from the magical water weight/carb weight that comes from starting a diet, but still it is the largest amount of weight I've ever lost in a week. My old record was 4. 

I have read a fair few posts and articles about keto and I'm pretty sure I understand the process, though I am skipping a few steps. 

I do not know my macros, I do not weigh my food in-depth, I am very loosely counting calories and the only real number I'm tracking is carbs. 

My typical intake is between 15-30 carbs, it varies based on what meals I have. 

Are there any serious issues with not collecting statistics on my food?

I am taking a multivitamin and omega3 oil since I am not a seafood fan. 

I'm not eating like a sparrow either, my portions are large and I do not go hungry. 

I eat 2 meals a day with no snacks, an average day consists of an omlette (3 eggs, salami, cheese, salt, pepper, chives) as my first meal and a large portion of meat and brocolli for my second. Sometimes I switch the 2nd meal out for sausages and fried eggs. 

Driving water, black coffee and black tea. 

Overall, I feel great. My appetite seems to be getting worse every single day but my energy level is so high. My breath smells like fermented fruit and I am expelling so much waste. 

As far as I can see, I am achieving ketosis, I just hope I'm not dooming myself by not doing the maths. 

I know I'll give up if I need to carry the 7 and divide by 2 slices of bacon just to eat.

I was wondering if any of you have experience with high triglycerides while doing keto?

In the past, while doing keto I would bounce around from 150 to my lowest of about 37. 

Over the past year and a half I’ve significantly gained weight eating junk and not being able to workout, but recently have been trying to get back to keto and working out. 

The nurse called me back and said my triglycerides were extremely high (1081), but I immediately told her I wasn’t fasted, to which she then replied “regardless it shouldn’t be near that amount”.

That morning I had sandwich meat, 6 ounces of ground beef, a slice of cheese, a carb balance tortilla, and a probably a decent amount of Mayo on the side to dip in. About 5 hours later I went to get labs done but specifically told them I wasn’t fasted and that I’d have to wait for the lipid panel(which I guess they tested).

I’d feel more at ease knowing my triglycerides are high if they were somewhere around 300-400, but I’m wondering if me eating a high fat meal hours before can influence them that much?

I thought a keto diet might end my carb cravings and bring me a peace of mind, but I tried it three times already and it never worked.

It´s the exact same thing every single time: The first two days I feel fine, but then on the third day I wake up with a racing heart beat, feeling like I have the worst panic attack of my life, or a heart attack or something. I also get violently sick and the throwing-up only stops after several hours and only after eating something like a piece of toast, because simply the thought of eating more fat makes me sick again.

I thought it was an extreme kind of keto flue, but then I´ve read that it could be a severe reaction to histamine. I think it´s called histamine dumping? 

Now I don´t really understand why that happened, I basically ate the same, fresh foods as usual, I drank a lot of water, I basically just cut out the bread and the oats from my diet until I hit the requiered macros and thats it.

I take birth control so I was expecting to have no issues hormonally, as I’ve had no issues for the past year and a half in terms of regularity. Immediately after switching to keto my cycle is very off and even a few months in has yet to adjust. It hasn’t stopped, it’s just irregular. Should I up my carb intake? I try to stay under 15g of (net) carbs per day so maybe I’m being too restrictive. I’m also only eating around 900-1100 calories because I’m usually not hungry enough for more and I can’t exercise due to a recent surgery. I was usually eating around 1100-1200 calories daily and weight lifting 5x per week. I’ve been worried about my hormones since my cycle has been off and I’ve heard keto can be a part of that. I’m also worried about not eating enough, even though I know 900 calories isn’t enough I’m just not that hungry on keto. Are there any adjustments I could make to maybe help keto work for me, or should I switch to something like a plain calorie defecit and focus on getting my calorie intake correct? If it means anything I calculated my BMR and its around 1360 calories, but it also said something about my intake for sedentary activity level (right now) should be around 1595. Im not sure if thats useful in helping me decide what I should do. I just know it’s probably not good for my body to be 400-600 calories short of my BMR. I dont know how accurate that is to be fair, I also understand that eating less than 1200 calories per day is unhealthy. Should I prioritize calorie intake or following keto?

Fortunately, most of the food is healthy, I can usually avoid the carbs and sweets easily.

However, I feel stressed every time I open the fridge and see tons of leftovers. I just feel bad about it going to waste. Thus, to help that guilt I find myself wanting to eat a little more. For example, I’ll grab an extra rib just to get rid of the leftovers.

It’s crazy that I’m worried about this because I’m not paying for the food. Has anyone else experienced this type of guilt?",2355691,1617649758,2021-04-06 03:09:18,1413886,17,1

keto,mkqq9g,MozartsBoner,"NSV: Loose Watches and Wedding Rings and Adam's Apples, Oh My!","Just wanted to share a few NSV's I've experienced recently.  I started my keto journey for the 3rd or 4th time on December 15th, so I'm coming up on 4 months of keto.  While in the past I've succumbed to cheat days that just never ended or went on vacations where it was very difficult to find food that was keto-friendly, this pandemic has actually helped me!  I haven't had a single cheat day that I would consider a cheat day.  I've generally kept to less than 20g carbs per day, only once or twice going up to 35-40.  I'm mostly OMAD but sometimes TMAD on weekends.   I don't really snack throughout the day, and whenever I feel those hunger pangs, I just drink water until I'm full and that satiates me for a while.

I started at around 325 - that's my best guess.  I don't know exactly because A) I was afraid to step on the scale, and B) my scale doesn't go above 300.  I'm currently at about 275, so around 50 pounds lost in 4 months.

While I have seemed to plateau a little bit scale-weight wise recently (seemed to be stuck around 280 for a couple weeks), that has begun dropping again.

I've found that when washing my hands, my wedding rings falls off if I'm not careful, and it's super loose regularly.  I usually take it off when cooking dinner as I wash my hands frequently and sometimes forget to put it back on.  My husband has even brought it to me asking if I was planning on leaving him since I keep leaving it places lol.  Unfortunately it's made of titanium so it can't be resized, but we only bought cheap rings at the start of our marriage with the intention of getting nicer ones in the future.  Maybe this is the impetus for that!

I recently found a fitbit and decided to charge it and wear it some more - I haven't worn it in probably 6 months, and now, it's so loose that I need to take another link out of the strap!

Most noticeable to me, was that I can actually SEE my Adam's Apple now!  I went so long not even realizing I couldn't see it, but my neck was so fat that it was hidden.  Now that I can see it again, I notice how many of my facial features have changed, and it's all the more motivation to keep going!

5'7""   
CW 165 GW 135

I started keto three weeks ago, after not being able to lose any weight with weeks of 16:8 intermittent fasting. I'm not someone who has ever been able to count calories or limit portions, so it seemed like keto was the diet for me. I read about which foods to avoid and which were allowed, and made it my goal to consumer no more than 20g of carbs per day (not net carbs, but total carbs). Because I didn't weigh portions or count calories, I can't be sure I always made the target, but here is what I did:

* Check the labels on everything that has a label, to make sure not to accidentally consume too many carbs
* Cut out sugar and anything with added sugar (occasionally using a pinch of monkfruit to sweeten my coffee or whipped cream)
* absolutely nothing carb-heavy such as bread, rice, or pasta. No legumes.
* Ate fish, seafood, and meats including beef, chicken, pork, and sausages, either sauteed or grilled and without breading
* Plenty of eggs
* Vegetables including snap peas, fennel, greens, avocado, radish, cabbage, broccoli, and asparagus. Carrots and cherry tomatoes in small amounts
* Fruits: raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, about 1/2 to 1 cup a day
* heavy cream in my coffee and whipped on my berries
* Spirits such as gin and vodka, as well as hard seltzers (2g of carbs each)

This was a huge change to my diet. It was difficult and I was sometimes miserable. The first week I felt physically ill and didn't have a lot of appetite. The next 2 weeks I felt normal. 

No change to the amount of exercise I get, which is not a lot. Mostly walking.

For the first 2 weeks my weight didn't change. At the end of the third week I had gained 3 pounds.

I've read on here about people counting calories, fasting with keto, doing ""macros"" (don't understand that), etc. I just don't think I could stick with a diet that required too much calculating. 

Should I give up on keto? Does it just not work for some people?",2355486,1617634171,2021-04-05 22:49:31,1429473,39,1

At first, overcoming the desire for a sweet taste didn't seem so hard. But now, I find it harder, since everything I eat is salty/savoury. I'll chew sugar-free gum, but that doesn't always do it. 

Last night, I succumbed to the temptation and had the first carby/processed/garbage thing in two months (a bowl of rice Chex). Now I'm afraid that since I've ""fallen off the wagon"" once, I'll be able to justify/rationalise it easier next time.

They're pretty generic tasting things, but when you want a cold beer on a hot day, it did the trick.   
   
I was in my friend's backyard, and he was telling me how there is hops growing on the fence line.   
We were checking it out, because plants are neat.   
He told me that if you chew on it, (not eat) it tastes like a hoppy beer.   
I did. He was right.   


He let me pick some. I took it home, chopped it up, and mixed it into a can of low carb beer.   
I did not drink it right then and there,  but rather I put it in the fridge in a sealed container.   


I waited about 3 days.   
Then I strained some out and used it as more of a flavour shot in a new can of beer, and BAM! Less boring, low carb beer. 

Now it's true, there is a small amount of carbonation lost, but I'd say a pretty negligible amount.

First I want to say that this transformation is nothing compared to what I’ve seen in this sub weight wise, you guys are amazing, but we all have our struggles regardless of the weight of the scale and this shit is about taking RESPONSIBILITY for yourself and your values. 

Your self esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself and it’s always watching you to see if you’re living through your values.

So a year ago little before my birthday I felt horrible, I worked 72h/w in a sales job. I was doing great sales wise with all time high records here and there but that shit doesn’t matter. I still destroyed my body and mind. You know just to be able to sustain the long and intensive days I had to constantly eat. I ate 6 tasty cheese every fricking day + breakfast and dinner, that’s just absurd. 

But of course... understandable considering the HUGE amount of stress the job gave me in combination with not living truthfully with myself.

———

After reflecting deeply on my values I decided to:

Quit my job and pursue what I wanted which was running why own company and getting my grades up. So I did just that. 

I decided that I wanted to have a body fat of 15% and hit 120kg bench press (which I thought was impossible at first). So I did just that.


This is actually about deciding who you want to be and sustain meaningful effort &amp; suffering. Because suffering is not bad, it’s quite good, well it’s actually a gift to be able to suffer for something meaningful and is the fundamental thing for most successes.

But if you have no direction and no meaning behind the suffering it’s a recipe for all kinds of mental disorders which will lead to other negative consequences.

Ben pakulski is someone who I've actively followed for a long time and who's muscle building programs have given me great success. He isn't someone who actively promotes a ketogenic diet but does follow the principles of it. Even before I had ever heard of the word keto, in his programs he always promoted a protein and high fat breakfast. He's never sought to be in an active state of ketosis but does promote a carb free approach to starting the day and pre training nutrition for the clarity and mental focus it provides over carb loaded meals.

Anyway, this episode is him with someone talking about following a keto diet and training for muscle building. It was good for me as a newbie to get an understanding into what actually happens on a keto diet and how you can utilise its benefits. It might not be for the seasoned ketoers because you might already have a lot of this knowledge, but for people starting out or those who just want more knowledge it's a good listen imo.

Now, some company came up with yet another wonder drug, they even call it 'keto' and claimed that one teaspoon in the evening would get you right on the full keto train and you lose 50lbs in two weeks. No exercise, no eating restraint.

The stuff is made of a mixture of hemp oil, olive oil and some amino acid. Nothing else. 
I know this must be fraud, you just don't go keto over night by swallowing oils, especially not when keeping carbs in your diet.

The crucial thing is, he wants to buy this ridiculously expensive stuff and actually thinks it will help him without cutting out coke, fast food and all the other unhealthy stuff he puts in his mouth every day.

How can I make him see that this is just the same make-believe as any other wonder drug? Has anyone heard of this and maybe have reliable sources?
I couldn't find anything except ads for it and the TV shows where they presented it.

Cheese
Nuts
Pork Rinds

I’m not going over 1800 calories but I typically never reach that anyway. I eat between 800-1600 calories/ day. Typically I probably eat 1400/1500 calories a day (I’ve only been doing it for almost a week now) but 1800 is a my max and i guess gives me a little leeway incase I get hungry.

I know since I’m younger my skin will probably bounce back faster but I was just wondering your experiences and what you have done to try to combat or even fix it after losing a lot of weight.

keto,mk8gxi,darwinDMG08,"Macro panic, anyone?","Hi all, #firstpost here. 

Almost done with week #3 of my first keto diet and IF. I'm working with a trainer and he's got me on strict daily macros: 31 carbs or less, 114 fat, 170 protein, about 1830 calories. While I've adopted to some aspects of the diet pretty well (I love a big lunch with meat, cheese and avocado and the return of red meat to my diet) but I have YET to fully hit my macros. I've come close; like today I'm closing in on 240 calories to go with 72P, 7F, 5C remaining. But that's rare, and what I've noticed is that I get in trouble towards the end of the day when I still have 400-500 calories left with a decent amount of P and F too yet no Carbs left to spend. I find myself PANICKING and trying to find something fatty to ingest right before my fasting cutoff; I've done everything from melting down coconut oil with peanut butter to making an after-dinner smoothie of protein powder and MCT oil. And don't think I haven't contemplated eating half a stick of butter out of desperation.

I know some of this is my old mindset – too few calories during ""sensible"" meals while supplementing with carb-heavy snacks – and trying to retrain myself to eat heavier meals. I also realize that I could be meal-prepping more so that I have good stuff on hand to snack on, whether it be hard-boiled eggs or homemade fat bombs. But I'm curious to know what y'all do to make sure you hit your daily goals and how you fill yourselves up at the end of the day if you're too far under.

keto,mk4ril,Rdsthomas,My first post ever on Reddit is a thank you to this sub!,"I've been Reddit user for over 2 years but this is my first post, and it's a huge thank you to this sub! I've tried Keto several times before over they years and lost 10 ish pound before falling off the wagon each time.  
I started reading this sub in late 2020 for inspiration and to learn.  2020 was hard for me like everyone, which caused some stress baking and the correlating stress eating.  In addition I had a severe 2nd degree ankle sprain in January 2020, followed by a horrible bout of sciatica in October 2020 that plagued me into the new year.  I was sick and tired of feeling sick, and tired and painful, and I knew my weight of 205 lbs at 5'5"" and age 40 wasn't helping things at all.  I knew I needed to shed some pounds to be able to get active without pain.  
I made the lifestyle change one random day in mid January 2021 (I don't remember exactly which day, I just remember which week).  I stayed on top of my electrolytes and macros with CarbManager and while the first week was hard, after that I was feeling pretty good.  Minimal keto flu.  Then, the positive changes started.
I previously suffered a form of insomnia (couldn't STAY asleep through the night), which disappeared pretty quickly.  I live with ADHD which I've never needed to medicate to function, but HOLY MOLY, I have a mental clarity that I have never known before.  My back pain and ankle pain have basically disappeared.  Whether it's directly due to weight loss, or reduction in inflammation, I don't know, and I don't care either.  No matter how you slice it, this lifestyle is doing amazing things for me.
So, this gal sat at 205lbs somewhere in mid January.  Yesterday, I broke through 180 to land at 178.6.  I credit reading the great advice and motivational stories on this sub with my success. I was stuck around 184 for a couple of weeks until I read here that I should recalculate my macros every 10lbs down, and that really the only macro I needed to hit or exceed was protein and to eat fat to satiety rather than trying to hit the macro.  These 2 things together made the scale move down again.  I started obese, and as of yesterday I'm down to the overweight category (though, I believe BMI is mostly bullshit, but I don't have body fat calipers or anything else to help me calculate where I'm at health wise) and have reduced some health risk factors!  
My first goal is to get to 170lbs: still overweight, but I feel it's a midway marker for me.  My ultimate goal is to get to about 140 lbs and feeling STRONG. I may go to maintenance sooner if I feel ""I've made it"", because I don't want to be skinny; I want to be strong, healthy and confident.
Again, thank you everyone who's contributing regularly.  With reading your stories and tips I don't feel like stepping off this path one bit!",2354832,1617570008,2021-04-05 05:00:08,1493636,5,10
keto,mk35jg,karluvmost,Doctors and Tests,"**1)  What diet or fitness related medical tests have you had that best informed your diet or fitness decisions and actions?**  

Ex:  I just had a Dexascan.  This helped me figure out the right amount of protein to maintain lean body mass.  My smart scale estimated 10% higher lean body mass.   Not needing needing as much protein helps me not go over total calories and fat grams. 

**2) If you meet with a specialist doctor related to your Keto diet and fitness goals, how did you approach researching this?** 

I'd like to meet with a doctor periodically to assess progress and changes given my specific situation.

Since  most doctors are now Zoom-friendly, the scope of my search can be US-wide, not just where I live in Austin Texas.

Ideal qualifications: 

1)  **Keto** knowledgeable / friendly

2)  **Fitness** and **weight training** knowledgeable 

3)  Able to prescribe specific medical **tests**,  
Ex: resting metabolic rate,  continuous glucose monitoring to see what I respond to the most, that food inflammation marker test, etc

\#3 is the main reason I need this person to be a doctor. 

I'm meeting with a dietician but she can't prescribe anything, even just for FSA reimbursement.

4) Ideally this person would be an **endocrinologist** or endo-smart because my thyroid was removed.

 

I'd guess there are very few MDs in the US who meet all the 4 qualifications.

Cut to a month before the pandemic got serious. I started up keto with my gf at the time. Really serious with it, counting calories and meal prepping. Who would of thought it could be successful if you dedicate to it. A few months into the pandemic with Lockdown in full force. I'm down probably 40 or so lbs. Relationship ended and she moved out but that motivated me for some reason and about September or so I was at a huge milestone of almost being under 200lbs! I started at nearly 280.

I costed for another could months and got really close to getting into the 100s! I'm pretty sure there was a month where I was depressed and lost motivation so I got off of keto thinking I could control my calorie intake and start working out. This didn't work out, my urge to overeat came back and I fully fell off the wagon. So that was 4 or so months back. I'm back up to around 260. I'm living in a new apartment, got my first vaccine coming up finally. Things may go back to normal. I'm currently on a business trip which requires me to live from a hotel for a couple weeks at a time. I'm ready to go back to keto and finally get under 200. I know it's possible! I think I may just have to stay on keto forever otherwise I just eat eat eat. Keto kept my hunger in check. I was hoping that this summer I would be beach ready but I got knocked on my ass.

My father died at 57 from a heart attack, I have heart disease in my family. I need to become healthier otherwise I won't last longer. I'm just coming on here to vent and write down my thoughts and maybe get some encouragement. That is something we can all use. Here is hoping I can get my goal of under 200 on the future!

But I'm having a heckin' time finding an app that will accurately calculate (net carbs, for example) what I'm eating.

I have done a lot of reading on the keto diet so I feel like I'm at a great starting place.   I hardly ever eat out, almost never eat pre-made foods (stuff in a can/box/jar/package) and make almost everything from scratch.  I just can't seem to find accurate software that'll correctly calc net carbs and one where I can add my own recipes and have it calc net carbs and other %'s accurately.

...There's a &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; of info out there...  it's so overwhelming...

If you can help point me in the right direction, that'd be epic.

Thanks.",2354583,1617548318,2021-04-04 22:58:38,1515326,26,1
keto,mjxgo2,shortiforty,Anyone Have Issues With Jimmy John's Unwich?,"I've been on keto for just over three weeks now. I've lost 11 pounds and lost a few inches as well. I've kept it simple, just making meat and low carb veggies, maybe a little dairy, etc. I'm doing 16:8 IF and tend to have to decent sized meals and a snack in the middle. I stay right around 1500 cal and less than 20g carbs a day.

Yesterday, I decided I just wanted something a little different but wanted to keep it keto. Most of the places here are carb heavy fast food, so I went with Jimmy John's because they offer the Unwich (wrapped in lettuce, no bread). I got the tuna unwhich and added in avo, cucumber, bacon, tomatoes, provolone and hot peppers. Seemed like a decent idea at the time...

Fast forward to around 6am this morning. I woke up with a raging case of the flaming shits. I weighed myself and I'd gained nearly three pounds overnight. I'm bloated, crampy and feel fairly nauseous. 

Did this kick me out of ketosis? Maybe just a reaction to the hot peppers? Was it their tuna mix itself? I'm just not sure. What I do know, is lesson learned. I do much better when I just stick to cooking my meat and veg at home...",2354574,1617547221,2021-04-04 22:40:21,1516423,17,1

This may be obvious to other people, but I didn't even think about this until almost three months in... and I don't recall seeing it in the FAQ...

I've gone from 290lb @ Protein/133g Fat/1800 Calories for a 27% deficit to 258lb @ 116/119/1616 for my current weight.

keto,mjwtix,GreenPanda22,How much weight do you usually lose in the first few days.,"At the beginning of March I started dieting just taking an eat less, move more approach. It was working pretty good. My starting weight back then was 337ibs, and the lowest I got was 330.2, but I settled in around 332 and could never really get below that. With a little bit of frustration I broke my diet, and decided if I'm going to start eating badly again, start IF. So I've been doing IF for a bout a week now. Last time I had weighed myself I shot up to 340 ibs. So I thought I'd give that keto a try.

I've been on it for two days now, and mostly been doing dirty keto (basically getting fast food and ditching the buns and ketchup) and staying below 2000 calories for the last two days. I was shocked to see yesterday I was 335 ibs, and even more so this morning when I was 332 ibs. I'm sure most of it is just water weight, and of course if I was 100 ibs lighter the drop wouldn't be so drastic, but is it common to see this sort of dramatic weight loss in the first couple of days? Day 1 I did a bodyweight routine my trainer sent me and went for a walk for about 30 minutes, but yesterday I don't think I broke 2,000 steps on my tracker. 

As an aside though, I'm pretty okay with keto for the most part. I've had some sleeping problems ( **sparatic** napping during the day yesterday, couldn't sleep until 2 in the night.) but I've also read that reintroducing carbs too fast is bad and that it should be done over two weeks. There's a video game I'm looking forward to in early May, and while losing weight you sort of need to pick your battles, that release weekend I'm going to enjoy myself within reason. So I'm thinking of keeping my IF as is, and keeping calories under 2000 ibs throughout April, enjoy myself when my game is released, then try to reintroduce keto throughout May.

I won't be doing dirty keto when I return though. I don't have access to a kitchen with my current living situation, but I think I can make a lot of meals work by just buying some pre-cooked hardboiled eggs and pre-cooked bacon, getting a rotisserie chicken, some canned tuna, and some things like avocado and mayo on hand. Then when I start getting tired of that there's no saying I can't get a couple McDoubles and ditch the buns.",2354548,1617545037,2021-04-04 22:03:57,1518607,6,1

I stopped 6 months ago and haven't took a single cold shower since. But now I live with constant cold hand.

keto,mjufgl,guyfromsaitama,Is it time to stop? Need heavy advice on multiple topics.,"So, I'm a firm believer in the Keto diet.

(FEEL FREE TO SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH AS IT IS BACKSTORY BUT IS NOT NEEDED):&gt;! I have always been thin. In fact, I often got complaints from family that I was TOO thin. That all changed when I moved to Japan for studies (and I'm still studying. Starting uni next week). I was staying at a homestay and they would cook for me every day. The meals were so big, I managed to gain a few kilos. Now, I went all my teens without knowing (or caring) about my weight, so I have no point of reference other than my pants started to break often. After that I started living alone and got thin again. Then the big scary hit us all and I started cooking more. I took a look in the mirror and noticed that I no longer had that V thing around the lower ab area so I decided to check my weight. It was around 92.3kg / 203.4lb. I didn't think much of it until one day I weighed myself for the hell of it and it legitimately said 99.9kg / 220lb. The idea of ever reaching 100kg just never crossed my mind and I needed to get rid of the weight QUICK. So I tried keto and effectively I lost 15kg / 33lb in a few months. Then I stopped for a few months and went up to 86kg / 190lb, so I decided to do keto again.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

In the past two months of restarting the diet:

I lost 5kg down to about 81kg / 178lb the first month. According to a fitness geek friend of mine, my IDEAL final weight would be around 77kg / 170lb so I made that my final goal. Here is where I need your help. I have been stuck going back and forth between 80kg and 81kg for a month now and it doesn't go lower than 80.6kg or higher than 81.2kg. I make sure to always wear similar clothes, and to always weigh myself in the morning right after waking up, after using the bathroom if I need to. I'm not overeating, in fact I'm only eating one small and one regular meal a day, and I'm definitely still in ketosis, rarely ever going past 10g of carbs a day. So, what am I doing wrong? I do have to say there is not much fat left in my body, but there definitely still is. Is it time to stop and switch to a normal low calorie diet? I did notice that it took longer to drop the initial 5kg than the first time I did the diet.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to problem number 2. I have severe ADHD and take medication (since recently). Quite strong one, at that. One of the side effects of the medication is dehydration. It's bad enough outside the diet, but on top on keto, it's a nightmare. I have a few concerns because I've never mixed the two before now. Could my medication be affecting my diet and vice-versa?  (Not medical advice, just asking if it's a reason to stop the diet.)

&amp;#x200B;

If you read everything thank you so much and I'm looking forward to reading your advice. This is genuinely stressing me out.",2354455,1617535405,2021-04-04 19:23:25,1528239,15,1
keto,mjtnd5,Kanekixo,"Almost died today, i think.","Long story short, I’m on week 2 of keto? Been going great. Today i unfortunately cut myself washing dishes and got stitches. After 15 minutes since the injury, we were still cleaning the wound cause it kept bleeding everything was turning white and cloudy, hearing got muffled. I swear i thought i was going to die. I blacked out for a few seconds and was sweating like crazy. Once i came back, color wasn’t coming back yet so i had to scarf down some left over fries and tacos my sister fortunately had just got home with. Ate the food &amp; Drank Gatorade zero on the way to the ER and started to feel better.
I’m assuming it was cause of the low blood pressure that i fainted. Doctor said it was most likely vasovagal, regardless of being bother by blood or not, it still happens. But i don’t think it was that. I mean sort of but i really thought i was going to die. Like i said the colors started changing and looking out the window it was really white and cloudy, i could barely even see my neighbors window when usually i could their entire house, chimney, fence and even the apartment complex on the other side of them. my hearing was practically gone. I couldnt understand my family when they were trying to talk to me. It all sounded very quiet and it didn’t happen instantly. This all happened with in a few minutes. I’ve never heard of anyone taking their time to faint...

I don’t really know the point of this. Not trying to bash keto, it helped me a lot. I broke the diet today and ate whatever i wanted (without going overboard) cause it really scared me. I don’t have a reliable source or guidance so I’m just winging it over here. :/ 

I’m really concerned about this diet with all the diabetes stuff i can’t get answered to. I only use sources that support keto but all i get is people telling me “don’t listen to haters”, keto supporter isn’t a hater... or “read the FAQs”. Yeah i did and it’s says the FAQs is not a doctor so do it at my own risk. 

Again, I’m not trying to bash but I guess I’m just really sad now i might have to give up keto. I lost 14lbs so I’m proud of that. Doctor said it’s fine to keep going but didn’t really go into. All they were trying to do is get me in and out of there.

keto,mjsty4,pieandablowie,Keto causing sleep issues,"It took me a long time to make the connection but any time I'm in Keto my sleep gets affected. When I fall off the wagon and eat carbs I sleep like a baby after a day or two. I only really noticed it because I haven't been very strict this past year and have dipped in and out making it more noticeable, but it's always been a problem.

What I mean is that I don't really have trouble falling asleep but I'll wake up two or three times a night and will only sleep for about 6 hours versus my usual 8 or 9. It doesn't feel deep sleep and is kinda similar to that false sleep you can get from some sleeping pills where it feels more like you just had your eyes closed for 8 hours.

Interestingly, I don't really feel tired during the day with less sleep on Keto but I don't wake feeling particularly rested.

keto,mjs98m,DeoSitGloria,Question about powdered drink mixes and an analysis on Maltodextrin,"So I'm totally familiar with maltodextrin and how bad it is on keto. My question is regarding the amount of Kool-Aid I make sweetened with pure sucralose powder. The idea of using the powder because of the maltodextrin has been vilified a ton it seems when I talk to people so I'm just asking here for clarification :)  


 For the [Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/2c726085-4fab-4745-88fe-0f8145f6c860.93bc05d0c57f82606b4315ee6dbe3e0f.jpeg) I noticed Maltodextrin is after Sodium, so each serving has 10mg minimum of Maltodextrin because there's 10mg of sodium in each serving. Preceding Maltodextrin is Calcium Phosphate, and if you look at the calcium at the bottom it says it provides 2% of the daily RDA. Under the RDA's guideline for Calcium, it says that 1300mg should be taken in daily. 2% of this 1300mg RDA 26mg.   


So if we assume there's 25mg of Maltodextrin in each serving, that would make 125mg per packet right? So a gallon=2packets = 250mg of maltodextrin. Even if I were to drink two gallons a day, that'd leave me at 500mg or half a gram of Maltodextrin (or half a carb) a day form kool-aid, right?   


Is the ill response to these powders accurate because I'm missing something? I feel like I'm not understanding a specific concept or guesstimating the right amounts of ingredients. I mean, the [Cherry Variety](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919Gey0CqJL._SL1500_.jpg) doesn't even have Maltodextrin in it. I originally got into this because it was suggested insulin resistance (because of things like the koolaid I make) is the culprit of why the last of my lower stomach feels like its been in the ""pre-whoosh"" stage for 2 months now and has what feels like the consistency of a water bed and extremely squishy.  


Super sorry about the wall of text. I've been on a very intense cut for the last 5 months and my macros are basically forcing me to do keto as of the moment. So I'm just looking for answers :) Any input is super appreciated!",2354360,1617524886,2021-04-04 16:28:06,1538758,11,1
keto,mjrvcr,murphy-murphy,Exited keto last night. Too much dry skin and keto rash. Will try again later.,"Tbh I’ve been on and off keto for the last couple of years and just last night it dawned on me the reason I get red scaly patches on my face and dry dull skin has been due to keto (or keto rash). I couldn’t understand why eating a healthy keto diet full of fresh vegetables and lean meat along with lots of exercise and water (2-3L a day) would cause my skin to get worse. Today I’m feeling much better and my skin is already healing after eating a can of kidney beans and an apple this morning (I can feel the moisture has returned when I touch my face). 

I do miss the suppressed appetite and wired energy of keto though so I’m hoping to get back on it in a few months of trying a low calorie diet but I wonder what I can do better next time? I was already taking SALT AND MAGNESIUM supplements but that didn’t help get rid of keto rash. Last year on keto I was using the POTASSIUM salt but still had the same issues.

keto,mjpbvv,IzanamiGG,Calorie Deficit / Keto + PCOS help pls!," 

So.. I started keto last March. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months. I've been maintaining it and losing a lil more here and there. I want to lose about 50 more pounds.

My problem arises now because I've become stagnant. I've hit that pesky plateau. I was looking into calorie deficit but I'm scared because I have PCOS. Carbs/sugar don't do well in my system and I gain weight super fast. I just wanted to see, if I were to switch to a calorie deficit, would I gain weight back due to the PCOS? I know that calorie deficit works, I've seen it, but sugars/carbs don't agree with me.

I know factually, that quite a bit of the time on keto I was not in a calorie deficit - I lost a lot of weight really fast and I was eating whatever I wanted (That was keto, but portions and calories didn't matter. I was just dropping weight like crazy.) I also didn't exercise. 

Now I take walks etc and try to do what I can to help with weight loss but I've been the same weight for a few months. I'm still doing keto so it's frustrating because it's always worked for me. I wanted to see how calorie deficit would work for me (if it would) but I'm scared bc of the PCOS. It feeds and thrives with sugar in my body and I am so worried about gaining weight back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think if I swap to CD I'll lose, regardless of PCOS?

keto,mjj4yy,TheRealMeSpeaking,KETO RASH/ACNE BREAKOUTS/DERMATITIS,"Hi everyone, I've been on Keto for about 7 weeks now and I've been loving my progress so far. I am 5'9 and weighed at 178 at the start and I am now 168 after 7 weeks. I work out about 5-6 times per week and lost roughly about 3% body fat.

On the 6th week I started to notice some rashes on my neck, back, and it eventually spread to my chest (keto rash). I began to have acne breakouts on my face and it just kept getting worse overtime. 

I did some research and decided to try out some bile salts like ""Super Enzyme"" on amazon. This is what made my keto rash go away over a course of 3 days. I also tried to up my carb intake to about 20-30 net grams until my rash got completely healed.

However my ance was still getting worse. For some reason, I noticed that it started breaking out ever since I stopped eating salads everyday. My face was inflammed and itchy after every meal with high fats. I was breaking out like crazy even after washing my face 2-3 times daily. I began to eat spinach, kale, mushrooms, and swiss chard every single day for every meal. After incorporating vegetables back into my diet, I began to see the acne go away significantly over 3 days.

This has worked for me and I just wanted to share this in hopes that it can work for those who are dealing with this as well.",2354020,1617489779,2021-04-04 06:42:59,1573865,3,1

I am a sugar addict, and even very dark chocolate sets me off into binging on all carbs in sight. For the past 3 months I´ve suffered BADLY from gastritis (no h. pylori or ulcers, luckily). I´ve been prescribed Esomeprazol (PPI) but I am still in great pain every day. My stomach bloats up to 6 months pregnant every time I eat. I´ve been eating meat, fish, chicken, eggs, ghee, veggies and dark chocolate. But also tried to include white rice the past few weeks, but that just makes me wired and I feel sluggish and craving even more carbs. My digestion is really slow as well. Feels like food is just sitting in my stomach. 

Is it worth going ALL IN on the keto diet to try to heal? I have been eating pretty close, but I slip up with to much dark chocolate every day, and probably eating to much protein and not enough fat.

I’ve been on track for the past couple weeks, but I’m only losing about 2 pounds a week at this point, which I’ve read is normal.

Since your body in keto still functions on the 3500 calorie deficit=1 pound, what are the benefits of being in ketosis after the initial water weight loss? 

For example we (my husband and I) have been wanting to add legumes to our diet as well as some more fruit for the extra vitamins and health benefits. If we’re only losing the same amount as a normal CICO diet, does eating 70g-80g of carbs a day from fruit and beans make that much of a difference to weight loss?

keto,mj7qsq,emstewie14,The effect sleep can have...,"Hello all! Just wanted a place to put this out there. Long story short, been keto before and successfully lost 30 lbs. had a baby and gained it all back, and then some. I’ve been off and on since a couple months post-partum and have just been too stressed/overwhelmed/exhausted for it to stick. Little one is almost 10 months and although teething is *killing* us right now, we’re in a decent spot. Given this, I hopped back on this past Monday and have been successful again. Lost about 5 lbs, feeling in control with only a few hard moments that I ultimately defeated. 

However, in one night I gained 3 lbs and I believe this is due to lack of sleep. I fasted until lunch, was within macros, barely over calories, was done eating by 6:45 and had a good 40 minute walk. When all of those things line up, I can expect to lose *something* based on all of my experience. Even if it’s .5 lbs. it’s something. 

Well. I gained 3.2 lbs and I can guarantee you it’s because I slept on the couch last night and got just about zero sleep. My baby girl had a rough night and when that’s the case AND my husband is home (he works nights) I will go to the couch. This is because he’s up most of the night because his own sleep is completely jacked due to work and he can’t stand to hear her cry. To honestly make it easier for everyone, I go to the living room and close the door so he can’t hear her and I don’t feel pressure to go against the sleep training I’ve successfully done with her. 

Most of the time, I don’t have that much trouble getting some sleep but last night I just couldn’t get right. Maybe some other factors contributed to the gain, but I believe this to be the biggest factor. It’s crazy how it can effect it so greatly. My husband is back at work tonight, I’ll be back in bed and hopefully baby has a better night for a happier scale in the morning, haha!",2353611,1617453685,2021-04-03 20:41:25,1609959,11,1
keto,mj7oqm,sunilgurja,Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic Reviews: Real Weight Loss Benefits?,"The Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is part of the extensive and constantly growing niche market for weight loss supplements. In the past decade, weight loss formulas have come to dominate the supplement market, which is worth billions of dollars globally. The United States is generally considered the biggest consumer of weight loss supplements, but much of the world harbors love for supplementation. At its core, the appeal of a weight loss pill is easy to understand. Taking a supplement can help to maximize the effectiveness of your existing weight loss routine.

Regardless of how much (or how little) you exercise, it’s always possible to improve the efficiency of your workouts and fat-burning routine. The basic outline for any weight loss process should be the creation of a caloric deficit. People who burn more calories throughout the day than they consume are bound to lose weight; this is a guarantee. However, metabolism varies from person to person. Some people seem like they can just eat all day long and never gain weight. Others just look at a piece of cake and seem to gain five pounds.

While popular media outlets may brand all weight loss supplements as scams. While we do realize that many consumers have had bad experiences in this explosive contemporary sector, some weight loss formulas are packed with efficient ingredients capable of supercharging your weight loss work. The Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is part of this tradition; the supplement claims that it can help people of all ages and weights regain control of their diets.

The formula’s powerful ingredients have been scientifically shown to help people lose more weight. Utilizing GMP, or Good Manufacturing Practices, the company behind the Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic claims that they specially craft each bottle of their supplement for maximum effectiveness. As always, it isn’t easy to find out the truth about a given supplement. The internet is full of sites trying to hype up supplements and wehttps://linktr.ee/Mayank21

keto,miz3bz,modessitt,3 month update: 52.4 lbs lost,"After years of being ""big"", I got tired of my feet hurting all the time. Figured my weight had some role in that so I started looking into keto after a niece had some success with it. I have a job that keeps me in the car most of the day and was eating fast food almost every day.  I had no idea my current weight because my wife's bathroom scale wouldn't go that high. Was guessing I was around 325-330. Started researching the diet, read the FAQ, tried a few recipes, and ordered a new scale. It arrived on the evening of 12/28. I weighed myself after dinner (I know) and was surprised to see I was 350.6 lbs! Yes, I needed to lose weight. 

I officially started keto on 1/1/21 at 343.4lbs. I initially bought way too much food because I wasn't yet sure how much I'd eat on a given day. I know the recommendation is to do a 20% deficit, but I went with 35% and have maintained that throughout. That gives me a low fat macro and about 1500 calories per day (now). That's a big step down from before when I'd sometimes have 4000 calories in one meal (I'm not kidding).  I started with simple meals. Eventually tried a few recipes - some I liked and some I didn't. I've now gotten into a pretty good routine and vary my dinners through different meats and veggies while keeping brunch about the same each day. 

I've had a few week-long stalls along the way. I don't eat out hardly at all anymore and when I do it usually leads to a slight weight gain despite reading menu nutrition charts and keeping my numbers down. After one fairly long stall I decided to try a fast (only water) - 11pm Sunday to 2pm Tuesday - and that helped a lot to get it started again. 

On 4/1 I weighed 291 lbs! No April Fools there! If I can keep up the 15-lb/mo loss rate, then I'll be at my initial goal of 210 by Halloween. According to the height/weight charts, my ideal weight is about 180 lbs. Not sure if that's doable or desired, but I'll decide when I get close to the first goal. 

For a long time I made excuses that dieting cost too much because healthy food costs more than unhealthy food and I'm not wealthy. It's cheaper to buy a pack of hot dogs and a box of mac n cheese than broccoli and chicken. Well, that's true, but I've found I have more money in the bank now than I did then. I might go spend $150 at the grocery store (usually less) but then I feed myself two meals per day for two weeks or more.

She committed to 30 under 20 for now, then she'll decide if she wants to continue. She's a big bread, chocolate, and milk fan so I'm finding some subs for her.

keto,miyfu3,bbyboo55,Need help in the form of healthy pushes.,"Okay so this is my very first post here because I've come to realize I need help in a very unconventional way.
I've done keto before, researched and not only reading up but actually understanding the biochemistry.
I lost around 25-35 kgs roughly. This was back in 2018 and I was on keto for a good year more or less.
So, I've gained weight after 2018 mainly because of eating and not moving.
I start keto but give up within 3 days due to one excuse or another.

Looking for some advice. I’m 4 months into my keto lifestyle and loving it and my progress. I’ve been strict with my approach, but luckily have found it easy. I typically average 21 net carbs a day.

As part of a favorite tradition with my 99 year old Godmother, I enjoyed a fish fry (5 oz cod and coleslaw) with her today for Good Friday. I realize this will likely throw me out of ketosis, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make given the situation. Is my best bet to get back into ketosis (assuming I fall out of it) to fast?

I plan on a 24 hour a week fast with just water and unsweetened coffee and herbal tea and a 16:8 keto diet the rest of the week. Biggest thing for me is I like a couple of cups of sweetened tea a day. I've picked up all the sweeteners my local supermarket stocks but can't find great info on which is best for keto.

They are:

Sweetex: Sweetener (Sodium Saccharin), Anticaking Agents (Silicon Dioxide, Magnesium Stearate)

Aldi Stevia: Dextrose, Steviol Glycosides (25%),Leucine, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, Magnesium salts of fatty acids

Silver Spoon Sweetener: Lactose (from milk), Acesulfame-K, Aspartame, Flavouring, Cellulose gum.

The Sweetex tastes awful but the other two are ok. Are any of these varieties ok for keto? I'll only be using them in the 8 hours a day non fasting period maybe four or five sweeteners. Cheers.",2353242,1617408836,2021-04-03 08:13:56,1654808,8,1

keto,mitx73,GetOffMyTrike00,[NSV] Keto had changed my relationship with food... for better!,"So back at the end of February, I (M, 23, 6'0"") started keto, cold turkey. I started at 265 pounds, eating probably close to 3000 calories a day, if not more. Even back in my college athletics days (I was a rower for a D1 club team) my relationship with food, to put it lightly, was a coping mechanism.

Feeling sad? Eat.

Feeling depressed? Eat.

Bored? Eat.

It wasn't healthy, and I knew I needed to change something.

So after doing a lot of research, I determined keto was the best fit for me, and even though it's recommended to ""slowly transition"" in, I just went full-in. I count my macros and weigh food out, and at the beginning, it was hard fighting the urges to cheat. But I didn't give in, and as time went on, the cravings went away. I started walking more, and just getting outside in general. 

And after over a month, I realized something: I don't need to eat to feel better, or just because I'm bored. I need to eat when I'm hungry to live, and yea I can snack from time to time, but food is for sustenance, not something to pass the time. And in that epiphany, I realized why keto works for me: it cut out my cravings and made me feel fuller, longer. It made me genuinely take stock of what I eat, and get smarter about what I'm putting in my body. 

My goal is 200, and as of today I'm down to 238, but what impresses me the most is not that weight loss, it's that keto has made my relationship with food into a healthy one! I may not stay on keto forever (probably going to carb cycling), but the lessons keto is teaching me now are going to last me the rest of my life, and I'll be better off for it.",2353122,1617398343,2021-04-03 05:19:03,1665301,6,1

Generally I am at my desk or on the couch. I am wanting to add in some exercise and that should help LDL?

I guess, can someone with experience please help me digest these stats?  It appears like my triglycerides are in a very healthy range, and if my LDL wasn't elevated everything would look good. Do I need to be concerned/make any diet changes here, or just do some exercise?

I have been on Keto for almost four years now.  I can talk about all the benefits I've had if someone wants to hear, but I'm really here to ask for some advice regarding micro-nutrients.

I'm prone to having anxiety attacks, unfortunately.  I've read a lot about them and Keto has helped me quite a bit.  But, I still feel that I'm not getting all of the micro-nutrients that I need.  I currently take a Kirkland brand multi-vitamin daily, I take some magnesium supplements, vit-D, and B12.  I also use Ultima electrolytes on most days.

Some days I get this amazing sleep and that is the main problem.  I don't get good sleep, generally.  I have an Apple watch so I track the sleep, hours, deep sleep, etc.  I got 10 hours of sleep and almost 2 hours of deep sleep.  When I get good sleep like this, I feel so much better.

Yesterday, I had a carb day.  We had sushi so I ate two rolls, and a few potstickers (gyoza).  I use soy sauce on sushi and such.  

I'm wondering if I'm missing something in my supplements that I need for good sleep and overall well-being.  I've had high sugar days too and that doesn't work well for ""carbs"" but I'm thinking that the high carbs like the rice were a good thing?

keto,mik404,cabritadorada,Weird blood work results -- Glycomark test says my post meal blood sugar is sky high?,"Hi Friends -

I just had bloodwork done for the first time in a while and most of it is as expected--slightly high total cholesterol

My A1C is 5.2% (normal)

everything else is  also normal except...

Glycomark is 3.3 - and anything below 6.8 indicates hyperglycemia and that I'm having very high blood sugar spikes after meals. 

Blood sugar spikes seems unlikely...my carbs are under 40g per day. 

I'll be having another appt and more labs but I wanted to ask if anyone else might know about this lab and if keto makes it less reliable? Or maybe I'm just prediabetic and it shows even on keto....

I've never had the Glycomark test before so I don't have results to compare it to.

keto,mijslm,we-will-be-alright,"Tired of hearing that Keto only helped me lose weight because of the ""calorie deficit"".","As a teen I counted calories like my life depended on it. Used MyFitnessPal more than I used social media. Went Vegan, went Paleo, ate only a meal a day, or no meals at all. 

I didn't lose a gram. I'd go back to binge-eating right away, to working out for hours, to googling unhealthy, lame, yo-yo ways to drop a few pounds. 

Then I started Keto, against my family's will. Against my friends' will. Against my doctor's, too. 

Within a week, my urge to binge was gone. I was eating three meals a day and each of them was satisfying. I fell in love with vegetables I used to hate, and working out was actually fun!

So miss me with the ""deficit"" bullshit. A deficit ain't shit if what you're eating only makes you hungrier.

Which is great but it triggered some seasonal allergies to boot. Today things seem better, and I am trying to increase my IF window. 

From a young age I've been prone to seasonal allergies, dry skin + eczema. There is not a lot of scientific information available yet but I was wondering if people have anecdotal stories of keto helping with allergies? Did things get better or worse for you?

Also, the only thing that helps with eczema is cortisol-based creams. As I wonder what kind of effect that has on the body, and if it is indeed possible to overcome eczema via keto. I have mild rashes nowadays, but when they do, they itch like mad, especially on my hands.

keto,mifliz,ithrowstacksonegirls,Maybe keto isn't for me? Give me an advice please.,"**TLDR: I tried keto, I ended up vomiting, having a huge headache and I was sweating but cold af. Should I continue or it's just not for me? I had 500g chicken breast, 6 mini avocado and 4 eggs for my meal. Was it too much? Should I eat more vegetables?

**First of all, I'm not against this lifestyle and I'm actually proud of those who are sticking with it.**

I tried keto first time in august 2020. It lasted 2 weeks because I went to an event where I had some high carb meal and yeah... Btw, I had no flu during those 2 weeks, only some insomnia the first 3 days then I slept like a baby.

Yesterday I tried again: I had some chicken breast, avocado and eggs at lunch and then, 8 hours later at night I was sick af. Terrible headache (nape included) and this urge to vomit. I was full of sweating and in the same time I was cold.

In the end I vomited 3 times a yellow liquid and after every vomit I had this bitter flavor in my mouth. I guess it was all from my gall (first time for me btw).

Idk if the amount was a problem and that's why I was sick: I ate at a deficit caloric and I had 500g chicken breast, 300g avocado (6 mini avocados) and 4 eggs. I'd go for more vegetables but I'm scared of carbs.

Now I'm laying in my bed with a headache (but without an urge to vomit or some cold sweating) thinking about what should I do. What do you think? Should I just continue with the same meal or should I eat something ""lighter"" like chicken breast + vegetables only?

Is keto for me or should I just focus on a calorie deficit moderate carbs and that's it?",2352609,1617349951,2021-04-02 15:52:31,1713693,15,1

I still have a large amount of back fat/love handles and a little excess fat on my tummy too so I’ll keep going until I’m at a healthy weight. I was so glad my family weren’t offended that I didn’t eat any sweets or the delicious yellow rice my grandma made and I even bought four bags of Easter eggs last night and didn’t touch a single one! I was tempted but the serving size has 18g of carbs so lol no. Overall, everyone was super supportive. Mostly because I just started with ‘I don’t eat sugar or carbs anymore’, no one was judgemental about it, and I even got to teach everyone a little bit about keto and explain how it has helped curb my hunger and destroy my carb addiction! I was honestly worried my family would be weird about keto but they were super impressed with my progress and it’s motivated me even more to push through to reach my goal!

keto,midfz8,kooltobekind,Plateau advice,"Hi there! First time posting, long time lurker. 
I am very embarrassed to be here asking what appears to be the most common question. 
But here I am...

I have been doing Keto since Dec 1, 2020 and have lost 18 pounds. I am very happy with my progress so far, but after 7 weeks I am completely stuck. My weight has not fluctuated more than two pounds during what I believe to be a plateau. 

My stats are 30(F) 5’10” 159lbs. 
I would like to get down to around 140lbs. 

My macros are 118g fats, 15g net carbs, and 62g protein. 
My TDEE is 1837 approx. 

Prior to these stagnant 7 weeks, I was consuming no more than 1200 calories. 

This is what I have tried:
For two weeks I increased my calorie limit to 1600, and my weight did not change. (This was the last time I saw a difference in my physical measurements) 

The past two weeks, I have been consuming no more than 1000 calories and my weight has not changed. 

I am always around half (or less) for fat consumption, never above my carb limit, but average around 80/90g protein daily. 

I have yet to eat one bite off program. I weigh everything with a scale. 

I do not exercise, but I am a horse trainer and am riding for about 5 hours a day/5 days a week, absolute minimum. I have no idea how to calculate what my expenditure would be so I don’t factor that info in. 
Side note: I have been having a hard time working during these past two weeks with my lowered calorie limit. I am frequently dizzy, even with adding additional sodium and electrolytes. Hoping that will go away soon...

I am very embarrassed to be asking this question, but please help. This is my first attempt at Keto and I intend to give it my all. Am I being overzealous? Any advice is very much appreciated. 

Hopefully all of the pertinent information is included and makes any sort of sense!",2352522,1617340071,2021-04-02 13:07:51,1723573,13,1

keto,micmrb,lefttoflourish,What are your go-to/recommended keto brands &amp; products?,"As someone who did this diet a few years ago and is now coming back to it, I am amazed at how many new keto-friendly products are available these days. I would like to compile a list of go-to products. Please share what your favorite keto products are. These don't have to specifically be ""keto"" branded products, but anything you regularly buy from the grocery store.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my favorites and their net carbs per serving in parentheses:

Pasta Sauce: Rao's Homemade Marinara Sauce (5g, better than most sugary sauces IMO)

Milk: Kroger® CARBmaster® Ultra Filtered Non-Fat Original Milk (3g, I don't like the taste of nut milks and so drink this instead every so often)

Chocolate: Lily's Milk Chocolate Style Salted Caramel Bar (2g, I recommend this whole brand but I enjoy this product specifically)

Sandwich Bread: Outer Aisle Cauliflower Sandwich Thins (2g, this is not ""bread"" but its great for when you want to make a sandwich, can be used for mini pizzas as well)

Ice Cream: (net carbs vary by flavor) I've tried Halo Top, Enlightened, Rebel, and other less known brands. I'd say Rebel is the best, followed by Enlightened, followed by Halo Top. Halo Top to me is more *creamed ice* than ice cream. This is somewhat of a problem with all these brands, but I'd say Halo Top has the worst texture overall.  Enlightened and Rebel are both pretty good, I gave the edge to Rebel due to flavor choices being more to my liking. I am actually going to try making my own ice cream soon which I'm sure will be better than all of these options. Still, these are good to know for when you're lazy.

Frozen Products: 

Costco Frozen Broccoli (2g, Package comes with 4 or so smaller bags of broccoli. Nuke the bag for 5 minutes and season how you like and you have some really good broccoli on demand.

I will add more to this list tomorrow &amp; maybe ongoing but I'm tired and wanted to get the thread started.",2352501,1617336775,2021-04-02 12:12:55,1726869,11,1
keto,mic89h,THROWRA_curiouscat,Are My Expectations Reasonable?,"I started Tuesday and I’ve gained a pound so far.. I weighed myself an hour or so after I ate today (which wasn’t the smartest) i’m also (TMI ALERT!!!!) on the first day of my period so that could make it even more inaccurate. I know you should really only weigh yourself once a week and in the morning after you’ve been to the restroom but sometimes I get the urge just to weigh myself.  I’m 5’5F and I weigh 263lbs (yikes) and I plan on losing 100-120lbs or so. I’m also doing IF 16:8 (so i’m only eating 12pm-8pm) and I’m hoping with both combined I can lose the weight within 8months- year (i’ve also been doing light exercises [treadmill- incline:5 speed 2.5 &amp; quad &amp; glutes &amp; one day i did do arms] minus today since mother nature came to visit). I don’t want to get discouraged so fast and have unrealistic expectations. I know some people lose 10lbs of water weight their first week but I’m scared I won’t really lose any (although my intake is 70-76% fat 4-6% carbs &amp; 18-22% protein).

keto,miaj1u,ilalli,I did the egg “fast” to restart my keto journey last week.,"Let me preface with: I know it’s not really a fast. 

I did this to restart keto after several months of falling off and getting back on the wagon. I struggle with meal planning, I like eggs well enough, and this was just *easy.*

I ate nothing but eggs and fat for three days. I either scrambled eggs in a tablespoon of butter for each egg, or ate a tablespoon of MCT oil for every poached or fried or boiled egg. I wasn’t able to do the full six eggs and six tablespoons of fat daily, I usually maxed out at four each. I had a bit of Babybel cheese on the side to have texture. 

Day two I mistrusted a fart, but it was just a poot. Day three my butthole got fried by all the liquid coming through it, repeatedly. Disgustingly, it was yellowish, and smelled a bit like eggs. 

I lost 7.5 lbs (water weight most likely) but now can’t even think about eggs for awhile without feeling queasy. 

Next time I feel the need to do something like this, I’ll probably just regular fast instead.",2352408,1617329031,2021-04-02 10:03:51,1734613,51,1
keto,miaczr,Zygomaticus,I've got 80kg (175lbs) to lose...has anyone here lost that much?,"I'm \~15kg into my journey and this month my weight plateaued for the first time for 30 days and to be honest it's scared the hell out of me. 

In the support groups I'm in (outside Reddit) it feels like I have more to lose than anyone else. Everyone else seems to have so much less to lose (most want to lose up to 30-45kg (66-100lbs)) and their advice/experience is often so different to mine and doesn't help me as much as I'd like because someone of my size has different issues (physically/mentally/emotionally) to face. It's extremely difficult to explain the differences to them because they just aren't this big and it's usually very small differences so they brush it off as insignificant (it's not to me) and that makes me feel very alienated.

So I really could use some exposure to first hand experiences and reassurance from people who've lost **at least 70kg/150lbs**...if that's you it would mean a lot if you could talk to me and answer some of my questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How much did you lose and how long did it take you? What type of keto (dirty/strict/lazy/clean) and was it only keto or did you do other things to help along the way?
2. How has maintenance been if you're there? Did you transition to another way of eating? Did things get harder as you approached your goal weight?
3. Do you work out? When did you decide to start working out and for what reasons?
4. When did you start noticing you were actually getting smaller? Specifically in the belly region which is so far the least changed part of me measurement wise.
5. Is there anything you wished you knew when you started that would have made things easier for you to lose weight or keep it off? 
6. What was your biggest struggle? How did you face plateaus and days where you just felt like it was impossible to get to/be your goal? I don't often struggle with this but when I do it's very hard because I don't know many people who have this much to loose, so I can't look to them and say they did it I can too.
7. Did you have insulin resistance and if so did it clear up or are you still watchful? Is there anything health wise I should be watchful for while losing weight? I've already lost my gallbladder (due to disease long ago), and I'm trying to ensure that I'm losing fat not muscle but if you have tips for that I'd appreciate them you might know something I don't.",2352401,1617328386,2021-04-02 09:53:06,1735258,65,1

keto,mi97sl,Forte_Omega,A week in on Keto-Is it ok to fill in protein with a can of tuna?,"So I decided to go Keto! So far I feel fantastic. Intensely limiting carbs and focusing on protein seems to have been the missing link in my life for the past decade. At 30 I feel better than I ever did at 20.

Ahem, anyway. I've normally been eating bacon and eggs (mixed with cheddar cheese and a 5 oz can of tuna) for breakfast and boneless skinless chicken breast for dinner with broccoli. I'm doing ""lazy Keto"" to start just to kind of see what happens. However, the combination of what is above gets me right near my protein goal, mainly helped due to the chicken breast. However, today I got sick of chicken and made something else, instead with ground beef. This of course has lowered my protein intake.

So my question is, I'm really full, but of course I don't want to let myself go below my protein goal. Is it ok to fill in what protein is left with another 5 oz can of tuna? I really love tuna, and I buy half of my cans in oil for the fat and half in water for just this occasion. But I guess it just feels kinda weird to keep on eating. Is the tuna an ok way to fill it in? Or is it better to go a different route? Thank you!",2352358,1617324309,2021-04-02 08:45:09,1739335,19,1

keto,mi6qap,Aykon3,Ive stalled and have a couple of questions,"So I've been on the Keto diet for getting close to a month now. I started at 225 (I'm 5'9 M), and at the start I was losing weight quite quickly. In the first 15 days, I lost 10 lbs. After that, my weight loss has stalled. I got down to 211 and now haven't lost weight for about 2 weeks. I haven't cheated at all, and I'm doing the exact same thing I was doing at the start. My tests say I'm in ketosis but obviously they aren't 100% . I eat basically the same amount of food every single day. A couple hamburgers with cheese, a hotdog or 2 and a decent sized salad with ham ,boiled egg, cheese with a drizzle of ranch. I calculated how many calories each meal was around 1700 calories (20% deficit). With around 40-50 carbs per day. But I also eat only one meal a day, two if I'm really hungry. 

1.  Do I need to do less carbs per day?

2. Is it better to eat one big meal a day with all of your calories and carbs in that meal (sort of intermittent fast) or have multiple meals a day with obviously less calories and carbs in each meal? 

3. Also, is eating the same exact food every single day bad? Does your body get use to it?

I've been counting my daily carb intake and to be safe kept it under 20 grams everyday but I'd have some snacks at night which I still counted but I didn't think much of it.

I weighed myself at 220 at the start and at the end only weighed in about 218. There were some times where I didn't know the carb count of some foods and I just ate it hoping it did not knock me off keto like at the last week I ate a dozen wings which had some breading on it.

I started at around 300lbs and I have been slowly working my way down.  I think I may be the only person I know who didn't gain weight during the strict quarantine here, but I didn't lose much during those months either to be fair.  I have been going pretty slow, in the last 5 or so months I added in intermittent fasting but generally speaking, I just lose weight slowly and I am OK with that.  I have always weighed a lot, when I am stick thin I weigh 165 pounds, I mean I am happy to lose another 10 pounds give or take but I am not fussed about it.  I am happy with my body where I am at.  I had sort of hoped that losing so slowly and using ample cream (and I mean seriously, I could not be more effing hydrated), would aid in not having so much loose skin, and maybe it did, but not enough... My loose skin is an actual problem.

This is going to be so much TMI, but we're all in the same boat here right?  My loose skin is a hygiene problem.  As we're getting into the warmer months here, I am struggling to keep under the flaps of skin dry, like we’re one hot month away from there being a smell situation.  My belly button is already questionable.  I don’t know how to talk about this with people I know, so I turned to the internet like everyone else does.  I'd like to think that if it were just an aesthetics thing, I would be happier with the situation, but I am honestly not sure how long I would be willing to play Tetris with skin to put on clothes before I considered surgery even without the present hygiene issue.  I know many people who lost more weight than I did and didn’t end up with as much, I suppose everyone is different.  I'm not unhappy with my body per se...  But it's hard to be super excited about losing 100 pounds and buying your first bikini when you have to do a puzzle of how to place your skin inside it every time.

But I want to know, has anyone here considered surgery?  Have you gotten it?  What should I expect?  What are some things you’re curious about if you haven’t had it? Or if you’ve had it, what things do you wish you had known beforehand?",2352208,1617309186,2021-04-02 04:33:06,1754458,38,1

I had just weighed myself right before showering, and was trying to get a non-compromising photo of my scale *(which I have learned is unnecessarily reflective),* because I am finally back in the 250s *(that's the SV, and 259.4 counts as ""250s""! - and today was 258.2)* ~~for the first time in a couple years~~ for the fist time in 5 years. I stood up WAY too fast, felt dizzy, and was suddenly knocking over the towel rack, bruising my knee, and lying on the floor thinking I was having a stroke.

After standing back up, and checking that both halves of my face were still mobile, I realized I had fainted and that it might be time to check on my Blood Pressure meds to see about lowering them.

SO, today I saw my Dr. and we're starting to reduce the meds *(the good NSV)* with the goal of eliminating them in the near future, because I keep getting readings of 100/60 the last few weeks.

While I was there, we discussed that I'm on Keto - she was fine with it, but not a huge fan, but didn't cast any shade on it. We're checking my A1C, Cholesterol (the regular panel), Liver and Kidney function, and I'm pretty sure Potassium\* too. Will update in a couple days with how those turn out.

Also, I wore pants to the doctor that I bought over a year ago, that were ""my size"" but which I couldn't get on, and now they fit great!

*\*One of my BP meds is Lisinopril, which is known to raise blood potassium levels. So I've been reluctant to add it to my diet.*

Mental energy is at the top, physical energy varies depending on factors. Since I started OMAD at the same time as keto, I rarely ever have any energy when trying to work out. But I realize that my body just needs to adapt. Overall I feel great.

But a few things worry me. First of all, I experience muscle cramps and somewhat of a headache unless I drink salt water every two hours. I bought some electrolyte powder as well with sodium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. I feel really great after taking that stuff, and I feel like I need to take it probably 3 times per day, and I wouldn't say that I'm really that active right now. I know that you urinate a lot on keto and electrolyte imbalances are a pretty common thing, but my question is; 

**1) Do I need to replenish these amounts of electrolytes all the time when I'm on keto, or does my body kind of adapt to it after a few weeks?** I know it doesn't really work that way, but I figure the body must find a system to kind of keep things in needs, and not flush it, right? I mean I must take a lot of electrolytes just to try to prevent my muscles from twitching. And my joints from hurting and getting stiff.

**2) Does the diarrhoea subside when my body gets fat adapted?** At least yesterday, I had to shit water at least 3 times after my meal. I realize that it's a common side effect during the initial stages of ketosis (or during ""keto flu""), but the body adapts to it, right? I've got some probiotic pills at home, which only usually makes me need to shit more and not necessarily make it better, but I can try those. I ate some saurkraut today with my meal and I hope that it makes some difference. I think there were some undigested pieces today too, yellow/dark yellow pieces, circa 0,5 cm/0,2"".

**3) What are the general symptoms of being dehydrated, except for being thirsty?** Can dehydration cause muscle twitches too etc?

**4) How long time does it take before I can get a little bit of physical energy to work out?** I must be very careful right now, a little too much and I just get generally drained. I don't think working out really is a good idea right now, since I might have muscle catabolism if I do so.

**5) Is a high conjugated bilirubin level bad in combination with keto?** I saw on my recent blood test that I had a pretty high conjugated bilirubin level. All the other liver enzyme levels etc were all fine. But is this worries me slightly, since the liver is part of what metabolizes fat, or the primary part  in the process. I figure that I feel fine in general at least mentally, and no real abnormal colours of urine or stool, so I should be fine, right?",2352019,1617293739,2021-04-02 00:15:39,1769905,3,1
keto,mhyb4l,Shiivu,"Severe Crohn's &amp; autoimmune disorder, are these foods enough for keto?","As a preface, I have a rare form of Crohn's (orofacialgranulomatosis, or OFG for short). It's teetering on the edge of developing into bowel Crohn's, but the condition inevitably develops regardless... Unless keto can stop this? I also suffer from asthma, hayfever, coffee/caffeine allergy, and various other immune related illnesses. 

I did keto for 6 months straight a couple of years back, felt great, but then relapsed due to the food I was eating on keto conflicting with Crohn's. All that changed when a suspected heart attack (I was only 27) turned out to be severe heart inflammation, caused by the mature cheeses and cured meats I was using as snacks. 

After that I've been eating clean meats, dairy, fats, leafy greens etc, but constantly been in and out of illnesses, fevers, etc. 

Long story short, I've found the root of the problem years late, coffee! It has seriously been messing me up to the point where I developed a fistula, the dreaded beginning of Crohn's. It still hasn't been fixed after 2 years, although the pandemic didn't help. 

My question is, am I able to live healthily on keto if my diet consists of meat, leafy greens like broccoli, butter, and peppers/onions/asparagus for flavouring? I can add macadamia nuts in too for a snack, as they are well tolerated. 

I have ketoaide supplemented to make up the minor shortcomings when it comes to electrolytes too, and the food itself is well salted. 

Each day has around 100g of butter total added to meals, in addition to using fatty meats such as chicken thigh and beef shin. It's also the only way I can add variety by switching meats. 

Sorry for the long post, but if I eat this way in addition to keeping on top of electrolytes and supplements, I should be fine right?

Symptoms of my illnesses have reduced significantly since switching to clean fresh foods and avoiding fermented products such as coffee and cured meat. I just want to make sure I won't be killing myself by eating like this!

keto,mhww2s,Clarkshark9,Update plus face gains!!,"[Update](https://imgur.com/gallery/wROScxF)

Journey so far. I started keto on 12-2019, I was 326 lbs and noticed my quality of life was poor. I went to a Dr who does medically supervised weight loss and I knew if I followed his instructions I would have success. I already knew lots about it, but he taught me all about the keto diet and told me to follow the carb/protein/fat numbers he set for me, and gave me basically a large FAQ folder to take with me. For the first couple months I saw him every two weeks, with weigh ins that provided a printout of my progress with nifty little graphs and all. We would talk about what kinds of things I was eating, how I was feeling, etc. and would be a coach/counselor/cheerleader. Once I was adapted to the lifestyle we moved to 3 weeks between appointments. I looked forward to my time with him and tried to avoid weighing myself outside of his office so it felt like a treat to see my new number. Once I had lost a good amount of weight, and my energy was high, he got me to start working out. I got a gym membership and was going 3-4 days a week!  I loved my gym days and was shocked that it had taken me so long to go. Everything was going perfect, then, Covid. I was actually at the gym when I got the text that they would be closing indefinitely in a few hours. No biggie, I went to the store on my way home to buy resistance bands medicine balls among other things to work out in my garage. I got everything set up, and never used it once. Going to my garage to work out didn’t have the same feel of going to the gym, and I just couldn’t do it. It’s ok though, I’ll just stick to the diet. By this time, no in person Dr appointments allowed. So I could no longer weigh in and get my cool graphs. I tried zoom style appointments but it wasn’t the same. I kept eating keto and on April 30, 2020 I was 262 lbs. 64 pounds lost in less than 5 months!!!! Incredible!!!  Well that was the lowest number I would see on the scale. I slowly started cheating here and there, mostly for comfort in this crazy new world we were in. Before long I was 100% off keto. For a long time I stayed pretty close to my lowest weight, I had learned about portion control, only eating when I needed to and stopping when my body told me to. Eventually I fell back into over eating, eating for fun, and comfort, and to satiate boredom. Pounds started rising and me new clothes got tight. I didn’t step on a scale for a long time. 1-1-2021, I stepped on a scale...312.  I was so upset and disappointed, I promised myself I would never go back to where I started. The next morning, I was 100% keto! I dropped down to 295 quick, and stayed there, for about 3 weeks. What was I doing wrong?  I soon realized I was using all the “keto” “low carb” products from the grocery store. I cut those all out and went back to basics. Meat, cheese, eggs, avocado, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts. That’s it, only thing I will put in my body. Today I am 272 and 10 lbs away from my first goal of getting back to where I was a year ago. I am hoping to hit my goal of 262 by April 30, the date I hit 262 last year.  I just want to end by saying thank you to everyone who shares their stories here. I read them often and you all give me tons of motivation. Sorry for the long post, but it’s been a long journey so far.

But, I think they are supposed to be about 2 g net carbs (subtracting out the allulose) which puts them on par with Rebel from a nutritional perspective.",2351953,1617288112,2021-04-01 22:41:52,1775532,10,1
keto,mhwrf5,xcheese08,Is my scale broken?,"A short backstory

I’m bigger so weighing myself has never been high on my to do list. The last time I knew my weight was when I went to the doctor for a checkup about 6 months ago. 

I started Keto 6 weeks ago and I’m loving it so far. When I started I did not intend on using my scale since I figured my goal would be “drop a shirt/pant size” rather than numbers. But I’ve been feeling so good that I decided to break out the scale about a month in. I was down 30 pounds from my last known weight. And I’ve been weighing every week and now I’m down 44 pounds according to my scale but my clothes still basically fit the same. The pants are a little looser but that’s it. 

Is this normal? Should I try a different scale?

FYI, SW:400 CW:356 GW: 250.

keto,mhwrbu,murlocksoup,"Exactly 3 months in, I have lost 20lbs, and I have repatriated in Onderland!!","I am below 200lbs for the first time in 22 years! The last 10 days have been especially amazing for me.

I am so excited to see strong progress lately. [As I mentioned in my 3-months-in (well, just short of 3 months) first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mce27a/my_keto_journey_thus_far_3_months_in_long/) in /r/keto, I had experienced. pretty strong progress though with some periods of frustrating (though expected, per the FAQ) slow loss. I recently realized, however, that I was probably sabotaging my progress somewhat; despite being fairly strict and tracking my intake somewhat regularly, I was eating unaccounted-for nuts and breaking my intermittent-fasting with late-night Scotch (double-whammy, calories + the interrupted IF). Needless to say I wasn't adding those nuts or drinks to my log in MFP.

Starting on 3/21 I started tracking every nut (in addition to everything else I'm eating) and stopped drinking as much, and definitely no more IF-busting drinks. The nut-tracking isn't as bad as it sounds - using my scale I know that 2 toasted pecans is about 5g, and 2 almonds is about 2g, so it's fairly easy to track that in MFP in my head now without the scale.

Coincidence or not, you can see a marked improvement in the rate of loss since 3/21, really kicking in on 3/26 where the weight started falling off. The only thing I really changed was what I mentioned above. **That's almost 5lbs in the 10 days since 3/25!** 

My caloric intake is lower since 3/21 overall, but I'm still hitting my protein macro of about 120g/day

Thanks to /r/keto! It's great to see everyone else's  struggles and triumphs, and posting helps me stay accountable to myself.

Cooking this stuff sucks fucking ass. We've thrown away so much food it's not even funny.

Tons of recipes out there, and so far every one we've tried tastes like absolute garbage, other than the steak &amp; veggies which is chasing me in my nightmares by now.  Prime example this morning: ""Keto Spaetzle"". Either you get a crumbly mess, or you get an undefineable slimey mass and it all falls apart when you taste it. We've tried 5 different recipes. They're all trash.

And don't get me started on Keto Pizza. Dude, that ain't no fucking pizza - it's an insult to pizzas if you call that garbage a fucking pizza. It's hideous, rubbery, tasteless.

Even something as simple as a iced chocolate. You can't get it to taste decently. Yes, we've tried all the weird named artificial sweeteners we could find (Stevia, Monk Fruit, Eryth-whatever, etc). 90% of them cause my ass to explode like I've eaten a boatload of Haribo sugar free (duh!). How the fuck are you allowed to sell that garbage.

Oh, and all that Keto ""Dream"" Chocolate Cakes or whatever - if people call that a dream I don't even know what to say anymore. It's a fucking dream alright. A bloody nightmare, is what it is.

keto,mhu7hk,foohQ,Weird sensation in throat after eating meal?,"Hey guys

So for lunch I just had a plate of boiled chicken, sauerkraut, kale, avocado and a frittata (eggs + small amount potatoes + red bell pepper) and while feeling quite full and satisfied, after 10mins or so when sitting down it kinda feels like acid reflux, but I don't really understand how this could be possible after 10min?  
I'm not 'tasting' it, but rather a feeling of hunger (but I feel full?) coming up till my throat. I'm using a standing desk by the way now, and no issues then. Only when sitting. 

I did get a stool test few days ago and results came in: carbs and proteins are not being digested properly (food could be found in my stools) and there's a lack of pancreas functioning which results in my liver working way too hard for what it should be. I did get yellowy stool in January, but since then.. just light coloured.   


Could it be that I'd need bile supplements? My naturopath prescribed me digestive enzymes and I also need to take a few natural treatments for my leaky gut.   
Recap of supplements: zinc, digestive enzymes, magnesium and probiotics for the intestines. 

I know I should be seeing this with a doctor, but I just find it weird my naturopath not suggesting something to support the liver/pancreas. :D

keto,mhu4gx,Clarkey_12,KETO &amp; Exercise,"Hi,

Like many others I've been doing pretty much zero exercise throughout the lockdowns and currently sticking to the below macros:

**FAT &amp; PROTEIN** \- 115-125g (usually around 63% FAT and 28% PROTEIN)  
**CARBS** \- 15g-20g  
**KCAL -** 1600

My BMR is 1727, I'm 187lb, 36 years old, 182cm. I'm now looking at introducing quite heavy exercise three times a week - likely burning between 800 and 1200 calories each time. The obvious principle would be to eat more calories on my exercise days but is this necessary? It would be difficult to take onboard those additional calories whilst staying in my MACROS and not completely changing my meal plans. As my calorie deficit is relatively small as it is, should I just continue as is?

keto,mhu0gq,nelly_bell,NSV: Korean Edition,"
Okay, quickest backstory: obese my whole adult life. In 2014-2016, I had lost 60lbs/27kg with Keto. (You can see in my post history how well I had done once). Moved to Korea in 2016, gained everything back plus a little more (and hypothyroidismㅠㅠ)

Anyway!

Since March 2020, I started fixing my habits again. I’ve been Keto since November 2020!

As of today, I’ve lost 63lbs/28.5kg! I’m 7lbs away from getting back to my low weight a few years ago, but still have much more to lose from there.

BUT THE NSV is something I could only feel in Korea...!!

Koreans are quite... truthful lol when it comes to weight. Sometimes brutally honest ㅋㅋ They are also just generally thinner, and there’s a high expectation for appearances here. So being obese in a country like Korea has been extra rough on my self-esteem (but I’m working through that, don’t worry!). I’m still AT LEAST 54lbs/24.4kg away from a “healthy” weight. So I didn’t expect comments for a while, but good lord at least I’m feeling amazing again, finally. 


I catch the bus to work in the morning and always wait with a middle-aged woman who lives near me. I’m talking over 4 years of us waiting together. She doesn’t speak English, and I speak kindergarten Korean at best. I understand more than I can say, but we always manage to have little “chats”. She takes care of me like picking cat hairs off my shirts, holding an umbrella over me, etc. It’s a cute relationship we have!

This week, she asks me (always in Korean) if I’ve lost weight!! I was SHOCKED she noticed AND said something! I told her how much, explained “no carbs” and “no exercise yet” haha. She was amazed. Today (a few days later), she said again how pretty I look and then tells me she didn’t eat carbs for dinner this week and she is happy she’s no longer bloated! I INSPIRED MY MIDDLE-AGED KOREAN BUS AUNTIE!

THEN. Tonight, I pop into my local convenience store. The woman who works there has witnessed first hand my absolutely horrendously trash diet for years. Carbs, microwave meals, crisps, bottles of wine... I don’t go in as often anymore because I cook at home and don’t drink right now. But I needed paper towels. 

Again, she does not speak English and I do not speak nearly enough Korean. But she asks me if I’ve lost weight!! And again, I tell her how much and that I eat Keto and she’s amazed and so kind and complimentary. 

I know I’m still obese. I stand out as a foreigner anyway, never mind being overweight. But like... my Korean neighbours are noticing and are proud of me. Despite the language barrier, they are making effort to comment! None of my Korean co-workers have commented yet. I’m curious when or if... haha. 

Also, bonus NSV: I just want to give myself props for finally taking the time to commit to learning how to do Keto long-term in Korea. I did it! I get it now! It’s actually become intuitive for me and that feels great.


TL;DR: I just cannot believe my Korean locals are commenting and complimenting me  ㅠㅠ",2351872,1617279351,2021-04-01 20:15:51,1784293,115,1

keto,mhoysk,poise-zaftig,Been on keto for a month and haven’t seen much result,"A little about me: I’m 5’2 and currently just returned to ONEderland. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I guess?) and hypothyroidism around at age 12. Thanks to these 2 conditions and gorgeous genes (/s)I gained weight rapidly through the years, to the point where I ended up obese by age 16/17. I have seen numerous endocrinologists and all they have to offer is birth control pills and metformin for PCOS and meds for thyroid. While thyroid pills never seemed to bug me, BCs basically took a toll on my mental health and I guess led to me gain more weight. And another excellent advice all of them gave was to reduce weight, which by the way didn’t happen even on a 1100 cal diet with 1 hour at the gym in the evenings and 3-4 km runs in the morning. Whatever little I lost, I always gained double that in less than half the duration. With all of this, I lost confidence in myself and developed tonnes of insecurities. My mom constantly reminding me that I’m fat, lazy, slow, hairy, useless etc doesn’t help either. 

In the beginning of 2020, I tried keto as it looked like the only way I could control my PCOS symptoms. It worked decently and I lost close to 13 kgs (~ 28 lbs) in 2-2.5 months. For me, that was a lot since I never lost that much weight before. Due to the pandemic and not having enough supplies, I had to stop keto and get back to a “regular” diet. A year went by and thanks to my chronic illnesses, I gained back all 13 and 3 kgs more.

On 2nd of March, I was determined and started the keto again. So far, I just lost 6 kgs (~ 13 lbs) most of which must be water weight. I don’t know what’s going wrong but I can’t seem to lose weight. I also have a lot of physical fatigue. As my mom says something that triggers me, I end up not eating as much as I probably should. I consumed a total of ~850 calories yesterday. For someone my size, that’s really less. This leaves me with practically no energy to workout. I’m trying to eat more often but I just can’t seem to get hungry. I believe I’m not on ketosis. Could you suggest ways consume more fat in smaller meals or any other advice? Not being able to lose weight through the only way that works for me is so painful. I want to at least get to 70kgs (~155 lbs) by this August. Any advice would be highly appreciated! 

tl;dr : on keto for about a month now. Not losing the same amount of weight as last time. Really stressed about this. Need help to maintain ketosis (cuz I guess I’m not on it constantly)",2351719,1617257201,2021-04-01 14:06:41,1806443,33,1

I eat very clean and almost zero carb, not net carb, zero, except for fiber.  Eggs, Bacon, Steak, salmon, clean cheeses, olives (Thank god for LIDL) and steamed broccoli or cauliflower with garlic and ginger.  I cook in a combination of GHEE and Beef Talow.  Lets call it 1000 to 1500 calories a day.  70 percent fat, 29 percent protein or close to those proportions.... and I take psyllium husk caps at every meal (for the bulk and for the digestive benefits)

ACV w/ Mother twice a day, Fermented Tumeric, Institol in the morning along with my other water solubles.  Fat supplements later in the day because I take 150mcg of Synthroid in the morning and try to avoid interactions (Good quality omega 3 only fish oils, 200 mg CO-Q10, 10000 IU Vit D3 every other day).  I supplement with minerals as I feel my body needs them.  With Pink salt and bone broth probably at least once every other day.

I do a 24 hour fast once a week, mainly because I end up just not being hungry (I don't count my keto coffees during the fast.)

I have (2) 16 ounce homemade keto coffees a day, 3 tbsp spoons of heavy cream, a tbsp of organic cacao powder, 2 scoops of HMVN collagen w/ MCT's and a good few shakes of organic Cinnamon.

My electrolytes per day are: 

5000mg sodium
2500mg potassium
800mg magnesium

Water is about 8 cups day (sometimes more if I'm thirsty, but felt I was drinking too much before and losing electrolytes.)

My macros are 10-15 carbs, 75-85mg protein, and 100mg+ fat. 

My keto is for medical purposes (migraine) and not weightloss, so I try to do a 1:1 fats to carb/protein ratio, so I can be 1.5+ ketones.

My weight is 120lbs, I'm 5'3"", and calories around 1500.

Anyway, since starting, I've been extreamely fatigued and sleepy. And it hasn't let up. I have not cheated, even once.

My feeling is maybe eventually when I'm ""fat adapted,"" this will change, but it's been a struggle.

I also wanted to mention that I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroid disease).
I took my TSH and t4 yesterday and they have indeed went up from last month (but are still in range.)

All my electrolytes and triglycerides look good.

I was thinking about asking for a t3 reading from my endocrinologist (since keto is known to lower that--though I'm not sure of the significance since I'm not using carbs.)

Anyway, do you think it's just that I'm not fat adapted yet?

Or maybe a thyroid issue? Does anyone else have thyroid issues who does this diet?

The last few days were the first days since keto that I actually stopped feeling ridiculously hungry.
So I take that as maybe a sign I'm starting to get fat adapted. Idk.

Any ideas or advice? It's been very difficult to live with the fatigue. Thank you.",2351222,1617211557,2021-04-01 01:25:57,1852087,17,1

So, I started doing 3 pasture raised eggs, 1 sausage, and a few mushrooms for my breakfast 5-7 days a week, and eating some liver and onions on the weekend. I absolutely LOVE eating eggs every day and they are my favorite food, plus local pasture raised eggs are basically multi-vitamins.   


However, I just don't think I have enough time anymore in the morning to cook this semi-involved breakfast, clean the pan, clean the cutting board/knife, and then eat everything. It takes way more time to make than a bullet proof coffee. So, I want to switch back to doing that every day, and eating liver or eggs on the weekend when I have more time.

I discovered the fasting subreddit.  My first 42 hour fast broke my plateau and helped teach me to eat slowly and smaller.  I also incorporated \~ 9000 steps per day at this time.  This pushed my weight from 210 - 205.  Recently, I started a journey based entirely in lunacy - I was inspired by the folks at /r/fasting to begin a 7 day fast.  I'm on day 4, although it has been a bit dirty, I've had 3 drinks over those 90 hours, but otherwise very successful!  I've ramped my walking effort up from 9000 steps to the 10k - 15k range, but I won't be sustaining that over a longer period of time.  I dropped from 205.6 at the start of the fast to 198.8 this morning.  I know much of that is water weight (which is puzzling, since I've been pretty good about being keto for 2 months), but it felt amazing to step on the scale and see a 1 in the hundreds digit!  I'm hoping that in the following 3.5 days, I can lose enough mass to stay in the 190s after breaking fast.

I'm posting this here because... frankly, I couldn't dream of getting nearly 4 days into a fast without keto.  Given the voracious hunger, I would have broke on day 1, day 2 at best.  Overall, I've lost about 25 pounds in 2 and a half months.  My prediction for onderland was the first week of April and I seem to have beaten that mark by one day.

I hope everyone is doing well thus far. 

I apologize in advance if this has been previously inquired upon. 

I have been fasting regularly and I have a regimented schedule consistently for roughly 2 years now. 

I get up at 3:30am everyday and in the home gym by 4:00am. My workouts consists of light cardio (bike,rower,jump rope rope) for about 30minutes and another 30minutes doing mobility/flexibility work. Then about an hour of weight lifting(not bodybuilding) and some CrossFit’esq type workout. 

During this activity, I am in a fasted state which I will break around 11:00am-12:00pm. Which translates to about 18 hours of fasting. 

My question, during this ketosis state my body is in, if I get a cholesterol check will it register an elevated result?

I am 45 years old and I consider my diet low to mid in saturated fat. 

I eat red meat once a month and do not regularly consume processed food. 

I apologize for the longish post here and thanks in advance.

keto,mh6p91,jkuzuz,Different way of tracking,"I recently recommitted to keto after a hiatus sparked by the holidays and which has dragged on a few months longer than I planned. 

I decided to do something differently with my tracking this around. I was using Fitness Tracker, which was fine, but the problem I had was that I would eat something that “seemed” keto and then track it, sometimes not until the end of the day or even the following morning. Even when I thought I was in good shape for the day, I often found myself in the 30-40 gm territory from sneaky carb content. 

Meal planning would help address this; but I am someone who really has a hard time eating things I’m not on the mood for. And I tend to graze out of the fridge for most of my meals; I only really cook proper meals on the weekend. Otherwise it’s just throwing together a plate of meat, cheese, and whatever else looks good. 

My solution is to compile a spreadsheet of the keto foods I like best and eat most. I captured their net carbs per my typical serving. I categorized them by general type and in order of what I should be eating (protein, veg, seed/nut, fat, condiment, fruit). Then I sorted the contents with in each category from most to least net carbs per my typical serving. 

Because it’s on my computer screen, it’s easy to track throughout the day, and then I can easily see what my balance of net carbs is and then look at my options by scanning the top and middle of each category when I’m running low on carbs. By keeping protein at the top, I’m channeling my snacking on that direction since I can scan the list until something looks good, starting with proteins (versus scanning my fridge and starting with cheese or hot dogs).  I’m still tracking macros and calories, this just offers a way for me to narrow my choices within the bands they should be in.",2351076,1617199148,2021-03-31 21:59:08,1864496,5,1

I was having a hard time getting enough protein in because I was using up my calories on too much fat, heavy cream, butter, bacon. I started realizing I needed to use less fat to leave room for more protein. My weight has definitely gone up and down the last week and a half, I was 211 this morning but I was 211 last week also, then it went up and down. I am not hitting my calories, my average over the last week has been 1107. For the most part I am not hungry.  I thought about doing intermittent fasting. 

Do I have to hit my macros if I do intermittent fasting?

Basically I am reaching out to the group for support and recommendations. I want nothing more than to succeed at this. I have not participated in so many things because I am not happy with the way my body looks. There have been times that I was absolutely not ready to diet but I am completely ready now and I want to get this right. 

I was always thin and fit, having 4 children and putting myself last has taken its toll on me.

Support of any kind appreciated.",2351046,1617196180,2021-03-31 21:09:40,1867464,22,1

keto,mh5b9x,mulvi54,45 Days In...,"I (31 M) have been overweight since high school.   Tried various diets and work out routines.  Most recently prior to Covid I was doing cross fit 3x a week and while I was getting stronger I was not dropping any weight.   I normally however around 255 after 6 months of CrossFit I stepped on the scale weighing 260.  I chalked that up to gaining muscle.  

Then Covid hit...

Stopped going to the gym. Continued my poor eating habits.   A year later I stepped on the scale one morning.   Mostly because I was feeling like garbage.  I had indigestion, always fatigued, muscle aches, brain fog.  Just over all bad all the time.  What I saw made me scared and ashamed.  I was nearly 280 pounds!

The next morning I started trying to eat better and decided to follow the advice my doctor gave me several years before. Without knowing anything about Keto I started a low carb diet.  Then I discovered this sub and went even further trying out keto.  The results were immediate.   I lost 11 pounds the first week.  Likely all water weight but I can’t tell you how much less bloated and inflamed I felt.   Today is 45 days on Keto and I am down 28 pounds.  Below 250 for the first time since college.

keto,mh4li4,EmperorOfEntropy,"Circuit Dieting with Keto.. any merit to this phenomenon? 2 weeks in Ketosis, 1 week just slightly out of it, &amp; repeat.","So I have done keto a couple of times for weight loss now, &amp; it usually starts off fast with the weight loss &amp; then slows down a lot a few weeks in (with zero changes in diet). I’ve gotten stuck like this a few times before &amp; there was a few times in the past where I took a short few days to week long break from Ketosis. For example; most recently I took a break to partake in a small slice of birthday cake. The very next day, down a pound. Repeat, down another pound. After a few days, up to a week, this effect levels off and then the weight loss sits stagnant. So start up ketosis again &amp; the weight loss is back to normal again. Then a couple weeks later and the weight loss slows down again. I’ve noticed this phenomenon a few times now &amp; I’ve chalked it up to comparing it to the enhanced effects of circuit training exercise.. in which you have short periods of altering levels of intense exercise to reap benefits exceeding that of a regular consistent pace for the same time.

keto,mh3ty2,Pawsandtails,Just wanted to share: Not longer in the insulin resistance and prediabetes range.,"I started Keto 60 days ago after my endocrinologist (I have hypothyroidism) told me my glucose and insulin put me in the prediabetic and insulin resistance range. 

He told me to eat less carbs and exercise and put me on metformin (I already took levothyroxine). 

Yesterday I got my blood tests results and I’m not longer in the range, actually, I’m way out of the range! 

I know I had help with the metformin but my doc told me it would be an eight month treatment... so I’ll take this as a Keto win.

keto,mh3jha,Cavaniiii,Struggling to lose weight at a healthy speed,"Hi all, I'm 24, 5'8 and most recently weighed in at 91KG. I know how I managed to put on the weight, but now I'm struggling to lose it safely. My biggest problem is snacking, after every meal I always wanted something sweet and then in the evenings I'd have crisps and biscuits, I knew how unhealthy it was, but didn't stop.


My issue now is that I'm perfectly content eating keto meals, but I feel like I'm struggling to eat a healthy amount of calories everyday. For example, yesterday I had an omelette with two eggs for breakfast, I didn't have lunch and then for dinner I had roasted chicken breast with a very small salad at the side. I wasn't hungry or uncomfortable throughout the day and feel like I could continue eating like that for months, but I know I'm not eating enough.


What do you guys recommend as good ways to increase calories, either through snacks or something I could add to my meals to improve it? I started last Friday and I'm down 5lb, whilst it's good to see those numbers I do acknowledge it's pretty quick and in future I'll just be at risk of yoyo'ing",2350972,1617188079,2021-03-31 18:54:39,1875565,9,1
keto,mh3e79,Optimal-Captain524,Custom Keto Diet Video,"What Is It and What Makes It a Lifestyle? A ketogenic lifestyle consists of eating the ketogenic way: low carb, high healthy fat, and moderate protein 99 percent of the time - even if it’s your birthday. What does it mean to eat ketogenic, though? Well, basically you eat in such a way that your body produces ketones. Don’t worry, this is not scary; in fact, ketones can protect your brain from Alzheimer’s and other problems, such as brain fog and memory. What if you started eating the way your ancestors used to eat? What would that look like? When you consider what your ancestors did not have, namely processed food, you can see what that might look like. The food around was that which was easily available such as berries, wild animals, and vegetables that are easy to grow like spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Because it was hard to catch food, they also had to ensure everything they ate was as high in fat as possible so that they could keep on enough weight to be healthy. But not fake fat, of course - healthy fat from fruit like coconut oil and olive oil. Some people also enjoy ghee, which is clarified butter, in this plan. That’s the other thing that is awesome about the ketogenic lifestyle; you do have lots of leeway in what you eat if it follows the main goals, which are to eat low carb, high fat, and moderate protein most of the time. Processed food is full of refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemicals that no one can pronounce and will leave you unsatisfied, always craving more. And guess what; it’s not your fault if you’re always craving more. They made the food that way. The food you’re eating is designed to cause cravings. Processed food is made to hook you on it, just like opiates. The food scientists know the exact combinations of fat, salt, and sugar to hook you. They’ve found the formula to make every meal into a drug. What’s worse is that this drug will make you fat, unhealthy, prone to diabetes and you’ll likely die earlier than you otherwise would. Even when you think you’re eating small amounts of food called ""diet"" food, you can be fat and very unhealthy. In fact, thin people whoare eating a fully processed diet are also very unhealthy and prone to illness. Disease manifests differently in everyone. Thankfully, the ketogenic diet has become more mainstream. People are taking to it and getting healthier. They’re getting healthier because it’s simple. They don’t have to think too hard to know whether they can have that food or not. Due to this fact, it makes it easy for the ketogenic way of eating to become a full-on lifestyle. That’s good, because one thing that can ensure that people really change for life, and make eating keto a habit, is to turn it into a lifestyle. When you know you’re going to live this way forever, that you’re not taking breaks, and that you’re not doing it for just the next few weeks until the big party, then you tend to stick to a healthier way of eating because it’s just normal and natural. Since ketogenetic eating is so natural, you’ll agree that it can easily become a lifestyle.",2350963,1617187440,2021-03-31 18:44:00,1876204,3,1

keto,mgyvrx,redditorrheart,Good sign or bad sign? Metallic taste in mouth?,"Tl,dr: history of binge starve / eating disorder, trying to be healthier. Been on keto two weeks, still overeating on keto. Got metallic taste in mouth and realizing that’s a sign I’m in ketosis. Wondering if my appetite will decrease with time considering I am doing keto correctly this time.

Hey! From my other posts, I described my struggle with binge eating.. The reason why I am posting it here is because I noticed my binge eating got worse when I started “keto” months ago, and I am assuming because I kept going on and off+added many sweeteners to my diet which I cut all out. Anyways I am now doing stricter keto and am trusting the process. I want to say that these cravings are carb cravings, because I will eat and wait it out and still want to eat. But I am not certain, it could just be psychological.

I am two weeks in. I started the first week eating 3500-5500 keto. I know it’s crazy, I don’t know how or why I have such a big appetite. It’s NOT hunger, they are cravings. My appetite has reduced a little, I have few days I eat under 1500, but it fluctuates from 2000-3500 if I’m being honest. I am drinking water, but it’s seriously getting insane. I am 170ish 5’8bfemale. 

Anyways, you know that feeling when you are hungry, but you genuinely don’t mind eating? Like you feel satisfied with very little food. I’m trying to get that. I know some people will say “maybe keto is not for you” but then again, carbs will make me go even crazier, ESPECIALLY sugar, lol. So there is no point in me not doing this, especially since I am counting carbs far more strictly. Plus carbs make me tired. At least I can over eat and not want to fall asleep after a meal hahaha. I do exersice enough to maintain my muscle but that’s about it

So what I wanted to ask, was should I just trust the process? These cravings are insane and I’m trying to find out if they are carb cravings or if I just need to find some help with my history of binging / starving. I used to be able to lose weight easily, but that is not the case anymore, and I’m not sure why. Because I don’t simply lose all control around food, I eat and I wait it out , and when I realize I still have cravings, that’s what adds up the calories and causes me to overeat. It’s not like I come home and just eat everything in sight. 

But I wanted to share, today for the first time, I tasted that “metallic” taste and my pee smells weird, even water tasted weird. This didn’t stop me from overeating a lot, but it was a sign that I am in ketosis. 

So what do you guys think? Do you think that if I wait it out these cravings will go away? Idk if 2 weeks is long enough for not.I think I kind of got excited to realize that taste in my mouth. I thought “hey, maybe this keto thing is just in the process and your insane appetite will eventually adapt” and I am eating less than the first few days, but still a lot. I can’t control these cravings lol I just need to eat.

Thank you for the help guys, I really love how supportive this subreddit is!",2350736,1617167984,2021-03-31 13:19:44,1895660,10,1

keto,mgwzxg,DeoSitGloria,"Maltodextrin, Cutting, and Keto","First off just want to say that I love you guys. Around 6 years ago when I was probably around 17, I lost 40 pounds after discovering keto and it's always held a special place in my heart.  


So I've been hardcore dieting for the last 5 months and because of the strict level of the calories I'm at, I basically have no choice but to do Keto to hit my dietary fat needs and protein goals. My first question is regarding how long I've been holding onto what feels like basically a waterbed like consistency of fat around my mid section/love handles. I'm 23, 6'4 at 180\~lbs so I'm nearing the end here of my cut, but at the same time I just can't seem to drop this portion. I feel like I've had it for the last 2 months at least, but my upper abs have became more visible as well different portions of my body such as much more quad definition/minor striations. So I doubt it's the pre-whoosh effect/squishy fat. It feels nothing like the rest of the fat on my body which is why it's odd to me. In fact, it's EXTREMELY pliable. Almost reminds me of PlayDough or that magic-mud cornstarch mixture that got pretty popular for awhile. Very lost at why my body may be holding it like this.  


On a pretty unrelated note (I think? :\^D) do you guys have any idea about how much maltodextrin is actually in one of [these Kool-Aid packets?](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0055/0984/0947/products/KOOL-AID-UNSWEET-STRAWBERRY-KIWI-Packets-0.17oz-043000955277_16330-_B_grande.jpg?v=1576856176) I drink between a gallon or two a day of kool-aid (so 2-4 packets) mixed with my magnesium and pure, raw sucralose powder.

keto,mgv7ac,CleionaBellos,Can I get some support?,"Hi, 

My husband and I have been off and on Keto for the better part of the last two years. Every time that we've been going strong something happens and we end up going off. The first time was financial reasons, and the past year I've lost my grandmother and my uncle.  It seems like every time something emotional hits it triggers my anxiety and depression disorders and I end up getting some kind of fast food that's unhealthy. We quit this time because I was having near constant panic attacks about family drama and buying our first home. The stress that came along with moving and having t handle family made my husband suggest we use food for comfort while getting through this time. It did help with the panic attacks but now I'm feeling depressed, lethargic and I just need some support. 

The worst part is that I'm fairly certain I'm allergic to nightshades, (Things like Potatoes, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers) because I cut them out completely when on Keto, and whenever we go off Keto I get back my acid reflux, and migraines as well as acne flare-ups. 

I know that it's a mindset issue. Keto helps with my anxiety and depression disorders once I've been into ketosis for about two weeks and I'm feeling rather worthless and awful about myself. If I were good enough, we would have just stayed keto and I'd be on my weight loss journey. Instead, I'm the heaviest I've ever been, my stomach hurts all the time and I'm struggling with my daily life. My parents and siblings have never been supportive emotionally and it's hard to feel alone a lot. My husband is very supportive but whenever he's at work these lonely feelings just creep in. 

I'm not asking for any help in regards to my mindset, I really need to hear some supportive words from a community that understands my daily struggles with self-image and weight loss. We're planning on restarting Keto in a few weeks once we move into our home. 

Thanks for letting me vent a little, even just typing this has helped. 

TLDR: I'd appreciate some nice words and comments to help me realize I'm not the worst person in the world for struggling with the world situation and stopping Keto for a few weeks to help my mental health.",2350574,1617154670,2021-03-31 09:37:50,1908974,11,1

keto,mgtt3o,ZootFluteRiot,Worried if I should stop Keto? [TW: Eating Disorder Mentioned],"For a bit of background, I've always been a pretty average weight my whole life. However, once I reached my late 20s, I was diagnosed with PCOS, and also have a history of hypothyroidism. What got me to go to the doctor for PCOS was when I rapidly gained weight in a very short amount of time despite no changes in my lifestyle or diet (I was running about 20 miles a week and work a job where I'm on my feet). I was tested for insulin resistance because it's quite common with PCOS, but I did not have it. I didn't make any changes in my diet at all, but over the next year, I managed to drop all the (over 40lbs) weight caused by an eating disorder and being in an abusive relationship. 


Flashback to now, I'm 31 and in the last year and a half I gained over 60lbs, and I've never felt more horrible about myself or my appearance in my entire life. My doctor suggested giving Keto a try because even after adding 5 days of HIIT to my 20 miles a week, and religiously counting calories, I still wasn't making any progress with my weight loss. 

I've been doing keto for about a month (keeping under 20g of carbs a day, but I won't throw a fit if I squeak in 30g), and the first two weeks were definitely rough, but I was happy I was seeing the scale go down for the first time in forever. My concern is that I'm not really getting hungry now. Like, I spent my entire day only being fueled by a 10 calorie electrolyte supplement and here I am at 8:30 at night trying to make myself eat and I'm STRUGGLING to want to eat. I'm not sure if it's adapting to keto that's making me lose my hunger and appetite, or if it's my former eating disorder brain taking control again. I don't see my doctor for another month, but I'd be interested to know if anyone else has dealt with a loft of appetite and if it eventually gets better?

Weight:  from 127 kg to 115 kg (12 kgs! didn´t expect this much)

Glucose: from 105 to 95

HDL: From 47 to 44

LDL: From 140 to 88

TC: From 187 to 151

TG: From 111 to 136

Uric acid: From 7.7 to 6.4

I´ve been reading all of your posts and had the idea that my TG would be much lower that my last lab. 

Also concern about HDL lowering even more. 

I even bought an glucose meter and compared to the labs at the exact time and they come out almost identical.   My  glucose goes from 88 to 96 all day long and two hours after eating (keto) it only moves up to 100 

My uric acid is finally giving in, I am always above 7.5 and suffer from gout flares (in fact, just had one two weeks ago)

There are many indicators that I did not expect, and hoping that you can give me some info  I should talk to my doctot because I am afraid of what he is going to say about it (haven´t told him about Keto and IF)

keto,mgs45k,alwaystrivenprosper,Want to go back on keto... but scared of the judgement,"Earlier this year, I went keto for about 2 months. I went on it strictly for weight loss, but along the way, I found myself really enjoying the ""side effects."" I felt more energized, more alert, had a decrease in appetite, and felt more empowered/determined. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped doing keto due to a surgery I had to get and my doctor recommended that I return to a ""regular"" diet while I recover. Truly, I miss doing keto. For most people, it can be a challenging regime to follow; there's definitely a lot of willpower, determination, and self control that goes into it, but it definitely made me proud of myself that I was following through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people know that keto is under a lot of scrutiny by the media a majority of the time. I saw this with my friends as well. When I started getting into keto and had to be more conscious of what I ate, I felt judged and unsupported. The common things they would say is what a lot of people hear: ""This doesn't seem sustainable at all."" ""You're not going to die if you have carbs."" ""This isn't healthy at all."" ""You're just going to end up gaining all the weight back once you finish anyway."" I would explain the positive changes I was seeing, but it would go in one ear and out the other. Sometimes, a part of me felt like it came from jealousy. My roommates, on the other hand, had no problem with my keto diet, and frankly didn't even care that I was on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know people will say that they're not my real friends if they don't support me, but I don't like to fall under this line of thinking. They're great friends but I feel that people are more ""supportive"" of keto after they've done it. My parents were both keto for a year and my aunt has been keto for 4 years and they were super supportive of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is... What have been your experiences with judgment towards your regime, and how did you ignore/overcome it? What kept you motivated throughout, etc?

keto,mgqko3,jake429,Three Weeks In,"Hey all! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about three weeks into keto and I'm just really grateful for not only the diet itself, but also the great information I've gleaned by lurking around this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing essentially a form of ""dirty"" keto and 16:8 IF, I've been able to break down my (almost nightly) acid reflux to 0 (one occurrence in the last three weeks), tone down my junk food cravings, and get to a point where I almost forget to eat during the day! And while I don't personally look all that much different, the scale informs me that I've dropped 16# since starting. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few observations:   
\-I don't know if it's the keto or the IF (or both) but they do something magical to my cravings. Very little (if any) junk/carb cravings 

\-I haven't broken my occasional need for an energy drink in the morning, but it's definitely lessened. And when I need one, I reach for a Red Bull Zero or a Rockstar Total Zero. 

\-Fallen in love with chicken thighs! Batch-cook them in the Instant Pot, shred them, and store them in the fridge for a cheese wrap, salad, or just heated in a bowl with Franks Red Hot! 

\-There's still an occasional sweet tooth calling me, and I've discovered the absolute best alternative: Atkins Peanut Butter cups. 3g net carbs and they're as delicious as Reeses! 

\-Cheese. Cheese, cheese, cheese. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did keto \~3,5 years ago and went very well for me.  
In the last 2 years i've been eating a lot of junk food and got around \~118kg (195cm height - 22 yrs old) and now i want to go back to keto to regulate my weight and fix my lifestyle.

I did a blood test today to have a reference point before starting but the results are pushing me back a bit. I was reading  about cholesterol stuff but i didn't really found a clear answer for my situation.

So, my lipidic profile is the following:

**Lipids** 681 mg/dL  - optimal level between 400 - 700   
**VLDL** 35 mg/dL  - optimal level &lt; 30   
**TG** 176  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 150, borderline 150-199, high &gt; 200  
**LDL** 124,7  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 100, near normal limit 100-129, borderline 130-150, high &gt; 160  
**HDL-C** 36.2 mg/dL - low &lt; 40,ideal &gt;= 60  
**CHOL** 184.5 mg/dL - optimal &lt;200, borderline : 200-240, high &gt; 240  

This leads to a TG:HDL ratio of **almost 5** which is close to very bad from what i know. How close is this linked to junk food and how fast can you decrease it?  
Should I lower TG/increase HDL before starting keto? is this high because i'm kinda fat right now (**31 BMI**) and it will level down with time?  
Should i start keto at all at this point?

I would also consult a medic for bloodwork interpretation.

keto,mgjyem,Clarkey_12,Analytics - Comparison from my two Keto periods,"Hi!

I had a very successful first 'attempt' at a Keto diet last Summer which I thoroughly enjoyed - losing almost 9.5 KG and 3.5% body fat in 3/4 months. Whilst the diet was sustainable, I felt great, healthy, energetic etc. I did quit for 3-4 months and following the birth of my daughter and an over-indulgent Christmas break I had put pretty much all of it back on, which I thought was fair enough.

I've tried again this year, with some success - 6.5KG and 3.2% body fat loss in the same period, but finding it harder work and less rewarding this time around - I think as the gains are slower than the previous period?

I'm copying below the 'data points' from both periods and I'd really greatly appreciate your feedback to help me get answers to my two main questions:

1. I've used so many different calculators it's difficult to know what kind of weight and body fat % loss I should be targeting (per week) and if my Macros are (or were) optimised. I got the feeling with attempt #1 I was potentially losing weight a little 'too quickly', but that also gave me the flexibility to have cheat days knowing it would not derail me for too long.
2. Should I be taking the logical approach and reverting to my previous Macros where I was getting results I was happy with? I am currently 85KG which is by no means heavy, but my body-fat is around 25% fat which I am desperate to reduce. I do very little exercise currently, due to a combination of COVID and new family life - if that makes any difference.

**Attempt #1 (Averages)**

FAT - 120G / 65%

keto,mghchn,JunieBeanJones,Hi! 2 months of keto down (technically the 2nd will be 2 months),"And I'm feeling pretty darn good. Down 16lbs and discovered a few things along the way and feel as if I found my niche. My goal was 50lbs but with the more weight I lose the more I think I may only need to lose 40 but we'll see. I'm enjoying the journey so far as each day gets easier. 

I can't believe that in almost 60 days I have not had a single cheat day and it doesn't really cross my mind.

keto,mgge8z,endlessnotions,What are some sweet Keto snacks with the “right” kind of sugar substitutes?,"Hey all! I just stared keto last week and I’ve been going around the super market trying to find some easy to grab items that are keto friendly for my sweet tooth! I found lots of things that taste great, but I just came to realize that they all have Sucralose...

I recently started to read about the different sugar substitutes and their effects and from what I understand you want to look for Erythritol and Stevia? I went ahead and read the ingredient lists on most of the items, I found that everything I buy has Sucralose in it. After reading about all the different sugar subs I have to be honest I’m kind of turned off from Sucralose and I’m starting to lose hope that there is anything decent out there to snack on. 

So, I was wondering if there are any items out there that you guys may have come across that have different and more “appropriate” sweetener ingredients that you enjoy?

One big thing I couldn’t find was a coffee mate substitute for my hot coffee in the mornings! The one I bought has Sucralose too!",2350067,1617111964,2021-03-30 21:46:04,1951680,44,1

keto,mgg1ob,IncoherenThought,Is this normal?,"I started Keto March 16 (a couple weeks ago). I was around 193 then. I’ve started Keto twice before but gave up, both times I dropped 10 pounds in the first week. This time I was keeping up with my water WAY better however. This time I only dropped 4.4 pounds in the first week. Yesterday I woke up to discover I weighed a pound more than I did the morning before. I still weigh exactly that this morning. 185.8. So in these weeks I’ve essentially only dropped 2 pounds at most, since I will regain at least 5 pounds of water weight as soon as I go back to eating carbs. This diet is not going to be a lifetime change for me. I was just trying to drop some quick pounds before trying for another baby with the hubby.

I’ve been logging my daily food intake and have stayed well within my carb goals of less than 18g a day. Often I’m ending the day with 8 or more carbs remaining. I’ve also not gone over my other macros either. And have stayed within range of all of them. I’m definitely not eating too much and I don’t snack much as I hate virtually all sugar alternative snacks. My ketones tests all come back positive everyday.

Is this normal weight loss? Or should I just give up? Maybe Keto just cannot work for me. This is a very hard diet to stick to. I’ve no problems giving up snacks, as I’d already limited myself before I started keto, but no pasta or rice or bread is very hard. Still I could easily stick with it if it were actually doing any good but at this point I feel it’s not doing much of anything at all. Two pounds (maybe) in the first week is not worth it. I could eat healthier and force myself to actually excessive for that measly amount. Any thoughts, advice, especially from those keto veterans out there, would be great!

keto,mgbm1y,eXplagu3,6 weeks in and can't hit Ketosis.,"Male, 36, 93kg.
I was hoping to get some help about why I can't get my body to enter Ketosis.. .

For the last 4-5 weeks I've been attempting Keto, but can't get my weight to move (even a single KG). 

Biggest problem I've got, is I can't accurately macro track my meals, because I work remotely and eat at a cafateria (buffet) for all my meals. 

I've been using myfitnesspal to track my macros as best I can, this weeks macros (65% fat, 28% prot, 8% carbs) should be working for me. 

I ordered a few little additions to help, like ketofatbomb coffee creamer and keto cheesecake smoothies to help boost the fat, because I just can't get easy access to avacodos and coconut oil.

Look forward to ideas and thoughts on what's causing this, or what worked for you to kick start keto. 

Attached is the last 7 days of macros/calories.

keto,mg5xoz,Timid-Cat-2708,Nearing the end of Month 2!,"SW: 223 CW: 203 GW: 180 H: 5’3 F18

When first start I was totally lost. I didn’t know what most of the letters and numbers above meant. After a while it became apparent. I made an account specifically for this subreddit. I had stalked it for about a month before giving it a try. The current goal weight is only my first goal. I will be setting new goals after reaching those. Making realistic goals for myself first. 

The first month I lost 16 pounds. I started at the beginning of February. I was absolutely shocked by how much better I felt within that first month. No more bloating, more mental clarity, overall I became less socially anxious and never as tired as I used to be! Not to mention the reduced appetite and overall confidence boost that it gave me determination. No more of my reckless binge eating. 

During March I hit a miniature stall. I lost another pound or so in the beginning of March. The scale wasn’t budging at all after that. It went on for about 3 weeks. Not enough to be called an official stall. It wasn’t until this last week that the scale started to budge again. Even though it only budged a pound it felt like a huge victory after it refusing not to budge for almost an entire month. I know, I know, the inches matter too. Although I don’t really have anything to measure inches. But during March I also noticed my endurance had increase as some of you might have seen from my recent NVS evil hill post. Even though I have only lost 4 pounds this month even the small victories add up. Who knows there is still 2 more days to go in March. But I am 4 pounds away from onederland! Been almost 2 years since I had last been in onederland.

If anyone needs a push to start or get back on well here it is. Small victories count and they sure do add up over time. Also on a little side note, has anyone else like when they look at high carb foods they used to love, they just don’t look as appetizing anymore?

keto,mg3khd,Significant_War_7139,Depressed and feeling hopeless,"5'0"". 176lbs. I have been trying to lose weight for 2 decades and have never been successful despite my efforts, I have always exercised moderately. I have never been an over eater, dont even like fast food or junk but will over snack here and there but its never been a real problem as I never keep snacks in the house. I have always felt that I eat less than most people yet have always been heavier than most. Every attempt to lose weight has resulted in a measly 5lbs loss in 3 months or so then I lose heart and give up because the process is always painful for me, so then just go back to my old way of eating, even though my old way of eating ain't bad at all.

Anyway I started my keto journey mid Feb, weighed myself after 3 weeks of carefully logging my food intake with 20 grams of carbs. Miserable most if the time and wondering if I am just wasting my time like before and . Then I stepped on the scale and had barely lost anything, maybe 1lb, despite all the science saying its in those first few weeks that you lose rapidly, never seems to happen for me on any diet. I cried to realize I hadn't lost anything despite eating keto for 3 weeks. And I am eating the right way I know, I eat enough fat and protein to not be hungry but I miss regular good so much. 

So I will not weigh myself for a couple more months. I dont feel or look like I have lost any weight and its been 1.5 months, even fasted two whole days. Cheat days = 3.

But I feel so hopeless
1. Anyone out there who felt like their initial weight loss didn't even really happen like it does for everyone else?
2. How do you stay the course when you feel so discouraged,  when you think despite your efforts nothing will ever work for you and you see no light at the end of the tunnel.
3. I have heard a lot of people say there have been on keto for years. Wondering at what point you were fully happy with the keto lifestyle, no longer miserable with what you had to eat and did not even miss carbs anymore? When will I get to this point too?

I feel so hopeless, and kind of miserable because I miss the carbs. Everyday is a struggle even though I have kept at it for 1.5 months. I need some encouragement as I am about to throw in the towel.",2349629,1617063832,2021-03-30 08:23:52,1999812,32,1

keto,mfyhzy,Revolutionary-Ad9264,Not losing now but i used to melt away when I tried keto last year!,"Hello and thanks to anyone who responds in advance. 

I have been on keto for 6 weeks and have lost 4 pounds. I've been strict and have only cheated once with half a piece of cake at my own engagement dinner.  I'm frustrated because I tried keto a few times last year and the weight would melt off me. I lost 13 pounds then 17 pounds, but gained the weight back once I abandoned the lifestyle. I thought the next time I'd try keto, I'd have no problem losing the weight but this year has been so different! I've been the strictest I've ever been on keto and i have barely lost anything. 

\-Most days, I do about an hour to an hour 15 min of cardio on an empty stomach. It's not super strenuous, but I've mixed up doing walking and HIIT some days, and just walking and elliptical on others. I don't believe i'm over exercising. 

\-I ordered a Keto Mojo about 3 weeks ago and my fasting glucose is in the 70-80 range. My ketone level is consistently under 1. One or two days it went up to 1.5 but I mostly stay at 0.5 to 0.8. 

\-I did one meal a day for about 2 weeks, making sure my one meal was rich in good fats. I'd drink coffee, eat 3 farm fresh eggs, keto toast with 4 net grams carbs, and i would make an avocado spread. And of course, MCT oil. I reduced my cheese intake and nut intake. I do not eat keto snacks. 

\-Since I haven't been losing, I've looked into whether a few of the foods (like for example, the keto bread) are causing my blood sugar to rise. I've tested this using my KetoMojo to test my BG and ketones 30 min, 1 hour, and 3 hours after I eat. No problem with the foods! None of the ones I suspected increased my blood sugar more than 25 units at 30 min, and I returned to baseline by 3 hours. 

\-Yes, I get good sleep.

\-No, I don't think i'm that stressed out at all. 

Any help would be very much appreciated. Why am I not losing like before? Should I do fasting? One meal a day? I do that then read that the reason I'm not losing is because my calorie count is too low! I'm so discouraged and sad.",2349459,1617049082,2021-03-30 04:18:02,2014562,31,1

keto,mfy5yz,renatojesus1978,sucess," 

Depois de dar à luz nosso filho em julho passado, eu sabia que precisava perder peso. Mas eu estava com medo. Eu havia tentado e falhado tantas vezes que simplesmente não conseguia passar pela ansiedade, impaciência, autocrítica, desespero e derrota mais uma vez. Portanto, decidi esperar até que estivesse emocionalmente pronto para perder peso. (Graças a esta submissão, eu já estava mentalmente preparado e sabia o que precisava fazer quando estivesse pronto para me comprometer.)

Para mim, prontidão emocional significava aprender a ser grato pelo meu corpo. Tinha carregado dois bebês lindos (um que pesava 4,5 kg ao nascer) e era forte apesar de anos de estresse e alimentação estressante. Também tive que parar de ver minha dieta como um castigo por engordar e, em vez disso, começar a ver a perda de peso como um presente que eu queria dar ao meu corpo por tudo que ele fez por mim. E, finalmente, eu tive que deixar de acreditar que eu tinha que fazer Keto perfeitamente, e se eu não o fizesse, eu estava condenado ao fracasso e acabaria desistindo. De novo.

Quando reiniciei o Keto em 9 de fevereiro, me pesei, mas não tirei nenhuma foto. Eu não rastreei minhas macros ou registrei minha comida porque rastrear essas coisas sempre me fez questionar se eu estava “otimizando” meus esforços. Eu simplesmente comia alimentos com pouco ou nenhum carboidrato (principalmente carne, queijo, ovos, manteiga) e vegetais. Tirei uma foto “antes” alguns dias depois, mas apenas de frente e de trás. E então, algumas semanas depois disso, tirei algumas fotos depois de ver alguém neste grupo dizer como isso foi útil para ela.

keto,mfwyex,Bella_Card,Newie question,"Hello, Reddit world! I'm fairly new to this sub and I have a couple of questions that you all lovely people might be able to help with. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I started our keto journey in February. Since then I've lost a total of 14 lbs (Started at 289 lbs sitting at 275 lbs) which is an ACHIEVEMENT all in itself since I'm on a corticosteroid called prednisone for my asthma. Before keto, the hubs and I used to enjoy making yogurt in our instant pot because it was cheaper for us to make our morning breakfasts than buy premade. Since we've started we've been having a hard time finding a good yogurt that is 1. tasty and 2. still keto-friendly. We found some Kroger carb master ones that are pretty good and seem to fall within the carb intake we want but I want to attempt making it ourselves again but I'm at a loss at how to make yogurt at home that's still ok! Does anyone have any experience with this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Second question: Every year we get a ham for Easter and usually after stuffing our faces with delicious delicious ham, we save the ham hock so my hubby can make his fantastic ham hock soup. However this year since we're on the keto train, we're not sure how to make a tasty ham hock soup with no beans in it (his recipe calls for navy beans). Anyone have any good recipes they're willing to share with some newbies?

But my friend said it’s a good idea to have a carb cheat day after a few weeks. This way your body doesn’t go in sugar shock if you ever end up eating a candy bar a few months after. And I looked online and it says long term Keto can even cause insulin resistance/diabetes.

So I decided instead to do continuous 2 week keto  with a carb day between. So chicken and veggies every 2 weeks. With carb day of beans, potatoes, carrots, and apples in between. 

Would that work to prevent diabetes on keto?",2349383,1617044043,2021-03-30 02:54:03,2019601,31,1
keto,mfwc0a,MissBergman,Keeping it simple - Huge libido increase / no PMS,"(Long post!)

So a few weeks back I posted here, I was getting anxious about cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. I just kept going, mostly because it just made sense for my body (never - ever have I felt this happy before while doing a major change on my diet, and I followed most of the advice people gave me here). I am a 37 (F), mother of 2, and I still have some weight to lose. These last few weeks I switched yoga for belly dance, 3-4 days a week, kept eating fat, proteins, some vegetables (a bit of zucchini here and there, and cauliflower) and green leaves (spinach, lettuce, etc). 

So everything's going great, but I wanted to ask some of the women here, I've read many posts about Keto worsening your PMS, but my experience was the absolute opposite. I've been eating Keto for almost a month now, and I've always suffered before my period, really bad PMS, horrible migraines, a cyst in my right ovary that sometimes caused excruciating pain (having to go to the ER on some occasions), cramps, loose stools, vomiting, joint pain and binge eating. This month was nothing like that, smooth as silk. I didn't have any cravings (though I ate cocoa nibs before and dark chocolate with no sugar), I did indulge in hot cocoa with a bit of cream and some drops of stevia (don't really use sweeteners at all, but this time I did), and on my first day I'm feeling surprisingly better than I have felt in years. A side effect though, is that a week after I started eating Keto my libido went up, high as hell, like a teenager. I've been looking for an explanation but I still can't quite get it. Is it the estrogens because of the meat I'm eating? Have I always been healthier and hornier and I just got stuck on an awful lifestyle for most of my life? 

It feels crazy, I'm not even counting calories, I just stay Keto as naturally as I can, keeping it very simple, and I know I've lost weight (my balance is broken so idk how much I've lost), but I don't think just losing weight can make me this horny, or feeling so good about myself. Or work on my cyst and my ovaries, and PMS... It feels so amazing. 6 months ago my then boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore, I don't even know what I was thinking being with him, it was the worse relationship of my life, and as I look back now I feel so different from that overweight, overtired and turned off woman that I was then... 

I'm just so amazed by this return to health, so to speak... I've been approached by other men, I feel is something that it is also starting to show in the outside, so it's not just a feeling apparently. I had sex with a guy I used to date, but my libido still can't get enough (what's wrong with me? 🤣). I can't say that I'm feeling like running a marathon now that I'm on my period, it still hurts a bit, and I still use a warm bottle, but I'm not crying in pain or feeling indisposed. Still feel horny though, that makes me really curious. 

So, have any of you girls / women have noticed this kind of hormonal changes? 

TLDR: Almost a month of Keto, PMS went away, libido is high as hell. Want to know if someone has gone through a similar situation",2349374,1617043249,2021-03-30 02:40:49,2020395,8,1

keto,mfufrx,potato_handshake,Read Those Nutrition/Ingredient Labels for Sneaky Carbs.,"So I bought a bag of pork rinds the other day so I could have an easy snack while working. It was an impulse purchase as I was checking out at the store, so I didn't read the ingredient list as thoroughly as I typically would. 

Later that day, as I was munching on the pork rinds and nearing the end of the bag, I noticed the crumbs at the bottom had a distinctly sweet taste. Hm. Weird. The bag said ""zero carb"", but I know the taste of sugar when it hits my taste buds. 

So I flip the bag over and check the nutritional info: it indeed lists the carb count as ""0"". 

*Okay... Let's take a look at the ingredients then*... And there we have it: listed as the second ingredient is ""coconut palm sugar""... 😕

Is this a huge deal? Well, it could be for some people, depending on their daily allotment of total carb intake. But it might be just fine for others. 

My whole point is just to be mindful of what's really in those products we consider ""safe"" or keto-friendly. Be aware that even though the front of a package claims the item is ""zero carb"", there still might be undesirable ingredients in the product. 

BTW, the brand was 4505, and the flavor was ""Classic.""",2349301,1617038205,2021-03-30 01:16:45,2025439,3,1
keto,mftdha,joyalina01,I couldn’t make progress on Keto until I stopped trying to make progress on Keto (story and photo),"After giving birth to our son last July, I knew I needed to lose weight. But I was afraid to. I had tried and failed so many times, I simply did not have it in me to go through the anxiety, impatience, self-criticism, hopelessness, and defeat once again. So I decided I would wait until I was emotionally ready to lose weight. (Thanks to this sub, I was already mentally prepared and knew what I needed to do once I was ready to commit.)

For me, emotional readiness meant learning to be grateful for my body. It had carried two beautiful babies (one who weighed 10.13 lbs at birth), and was strong despite years of stress and stress eating. I also had to stop seeing my diet as a punishment for getting fat and instead start seeing weight loss as a gift that I wanted to give my body for everything it has done for me. And finally, I had to let go of the belief that I had to do Keto perfectly, and that if I didn’t, I was doomed to failure and would just wind up quitting. Again. 

When I restarted Keto on February 9, I weighed myself but I did not take any pictures. I did not track my macros or log my food because tracking these things has always caused me to question whether I was “optimizing” my efforts. I simply ate low carb to no carb food (mostly meat, cheese, eggs, butter) and veggies. I took a “before” picture a few days later, but only from the front and back. And then a few weeks after that, I took some side pictures after seeing someone in this group say how helpful it was to her. 

I am now 7 weeks in. I still don’t track anything, although I weigh myself every few days because the numbers no longer cause analysis paralysis. I’ve lost 20 pounds and still have another 40 pounds to go before I will be at a comfortable, healthy BMI. I would like to try IF at some point, but I’m letting myself settle into this new normal for a little while longer. 

And even though the judgmental voice inside my head is telling me not to post this, I let fear and shame tell me how to feel about my body for decades. Also, I have learned so much from this sub and have been inspired by so many people here, I thought I would share my story for anyone else who may be afraid to try again.

What I am still trying to warm up to is being a morning person. I’d love to make these for breakfast and take them to-go, but I just don’t have the time or energy in the morning. 

What are your experiences making them the night before and then heating them up in the morning? Is it okay to leave them in the fridge over night? Google has been giving mixed answers and I do have a sensitive stomach so I just want to hear from you guys.

keto,mfphvk,Luckcuelive,Personal Story,"Hello, 

My name is Alex and I have been on and off the Keto diet for the past 6 months. The reason I go on and off is because I am afraid to lose too much weight. I am 5""6 and hover around 150lbs and I try to stay around 145. I'm moderately active but I do not exercise as much as I should. I have a fast metabolism and usually relieve myself soon after any meal. That being said I usually stop the Ketogenic diet at around 145 lbs. My question is can I sustain this diet long term? I usually do Monday-Sunday diet with a 4 hour cheat window on Sunday to spike my metabolism back up. Is there a point where I will not lose more weight and just maintain?",2349140,1617024216,2021-03-29 21:23:36,2039428,8,1

keto,mfnjbz,thejackal811,[UPDATE] How the hell am I supposed to eat Keto with a non keto family?,"Hi, everyone. A couple weeks ago I posted asking for help because I cook for my family and I wasn’t sure if keto would be feasible cooking for both myself and my family. You can see my last post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m0enfy/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_eat_keto_with_a_non/

I knew I desperately needed to lost weight, but didn’t realize how much until I took progress pics and saw the amount of back fat I have. 

I decided to do keto the week my siblings would not be with me to have a head start. It was difficult at first, but I eventually got the hang of things. I should add that this is not my first round of keto. I tried it a couple years ago and I did lose weight but I didn’t stick with it.

A true test of this diet would come this past Monday when my siblings came to stay with me for the week. The food that we usually eat is filled with carbs from rice sugar, bread, etc. we mainly eat Caribbean foods which are filled with carbs.

I am writing this to encourage anyone in A situation like mine. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EAT KETO AND COOK FOR YOUR FAMILY AT THE SAME TIME. Yeah, it takes more work, but it’s worth it. You also have to be creative. 

Here’s what a couple meals this week looked like: 

Monday: Jerk Salmon, Asparagus, and baked potato (ditch the potato) 

Wednesday: Chicken Kabobs, yogurt sauce, broccoli, and yellow rice (replace yellow rice with yellow califlower rice) 

Friday: Chipotle 

Saturday: Homemade Burgers, fries, ice cream, chips (no bun burger, ditch the fries, rebel ice cream, and Quest chips) 

Sunday: Red beans and rice, stew chicken, baked Mac and cheese, carrot cake (okay so I didn’t have ANY of this. Can’t even have stew chicken because the base of it is caramelized sugar. I had a protein shake instead. I was planning to have a Cobb salad but got too sidetracked to prepare it. ) 

On Sunday for breakfast I had bacon and eggs in a low carb tortilla and coffee which kept me full the WHOLE day and I only had a protein shake at 1 am before I went to sleep because I was feeling peckish. It’s unbelievable how full this diet keeps you. 

Side note: does anyone know of a sugar alcohol that caramelizes the same as sugar?? 

GUYS!!!!! I didn’t not cheat. NOT ONCE. Not with the rice, bread, carrot cake, ice cream, Doritos, aloo (potato) pie, pancakes, English muffins, Mac and cheese. And this is coming from someone with binge eating disorder. 

I wanted piece of carrot cake so bad (I like to bake) but I stayed strong. I saw some carrot cake fat bombs I’d like to try, tho. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Just wanted to share my experience with someone in the same boat as me. Maybe I’ll make more update posts in the future with pictures, measurements, and benefits.",2349069,1617017691,2021-03-29 19:34:51,2045953,193,1
keto,mfnj27,BurntCornpuffs,Eating greens everyday is ESSENTIAL to loosing weight on keto,"For me personally, anyways.

I've heard friends and people on here say that the reason that they think they start to stall on keto is because of them eating keto deserts. I thought the same too. We were keeping it under 20 carbs everyday, so what was wrong? Then I tried something that I was avoiding. I started loosing weight immediately.

Were you still eating your greens? 

I found out that for me personally, it wasn't so much of the ""rebel ice-cream and general keto stuff everyday"" that was messing up my progress, I learned that as soon as I added green veggies into my diet everyday, I started losing weight again. Immediately. But I still eat the ice-cream, atkins, and everything keto related like that. I do this pretty much everyday. Like, now I eat 2-3 small bags of those quest chips (4 net carbs each (I know, but they are SO good)), two peanut butter cups (2 net carbs), two cheesy hot dogs wrapped in keto bread or one split keto tortilla (2 for bread or 5 carbs for tortilla), and a full can of green beans with butter and salt and pepper (I dont generally count these carbs, especially if I'm under 20 by that point). I lose a .8 to a pound every 2 days. I'll also switch the deserts out with whatever I have at the time, like pecan ice-cream (ugh, yes)

I now keep my carbs pretty loose. If I go over 20, its usually just 23, and the rest is filled with the green beans (7).

Idk if this will work for everyone (because you might already be incorporating greens everyday, and there might be another seemingly inexplicable reason why your stalling)- but I do hope that this will reach another me out there who thinks that eating meat and cheese and everything else just to avoid greens is the move- because it isn't. I learned that the hard way lol

keto,mfmeoz,Creative-Pickle-5560,Question about tracking fat,"So I decided I want to try out keto but have been running into a small issue. I pre make most of my meals for the week, and have been tracking my macros on a fitness app for a little while now and want to continue to do both things. I also want to be strict about my ratios for a few weeks at least because I'm on a caloric deficit right now, and on top of that I think its the best thing to do to get a feel for what and when to eat. 

My problem is that when I'm planning out my meals to try and figure out what to buy and cook I fall short on my fat for the day. I get to my full protein for maintenance, and about 100 out of my 193 grams of fat and then don't really know what else to add. I use olive oil/coconut oil to cook everything so I know I'm getting more with that but don't know how much to calculate I'm actually eating, some gets burnt off while cooking and when I portion out my food and refrigerate then eat the meals it's not like the oils are always distributed well or even all eaten. I would just add stuff like cheese and Greek yogurt etc to finish off my macros but I want to figure out the oils number first to try and make sure I'm still at my defecit. Am I just overthinking this or are there some rules people have that could help?",2349029,1617013283,2021-03-29 18:21:23,2050361,11,1

I got excited about finally finding an electrolyte powder that has 0 sugar and he said its useless because you need the glucose to absorb the potassium and other minerals.

I did some reading and found some stuff about how insulin/glucose increases cellular uptake of potassium and lowers serum levels. Theres also a relationship with potassium and insulin where low potassium results in low insulin and people have higher blood sugar levels. I can't really find anything else.

Can anyone help me with this? Am I better off drinking the electrolyte powder that has glucose in it ?",2348983,1617007674,2021-03-29 16:47:54,2055970,3,1
keto,mfks1i,YoYoDieter74,Time to get my life in order,"Hey everyone,

I'm M46, having struggled for the vast majority of my life with my weight, going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20s, yo yo-ing up and down, stabilizing at about \~275 for a few years until I decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band. That helped me out for a while, bringing my weight down to about 225, but I was building a ton of muscle at that point, going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength. And then, of course, ""life got in the way"". I work in tech, which meant long hours, grabbing whatever I could eat, and things crept up.

Over the last 20 years, I've also been suffering from mild clinical depression. Nothing crazy, but enough to add to the ""uggggggghh"" aspect of life and exercise, and coming up with excuses not to do X, Y, or Z. Unsurprisingly, things were a lot better during my ""healthy"" period, and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better. Easier said than done, especially when living in my head!

The challenge for me has been trust, and accountability. I'm married, with 2 kids, and am the cook of the house. My wife has known me forever (40+ years), and has seen me through all of my phases. I love her to death, and I know she means well, but she can be very judgmental, and over the years, I've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health, or weight. I just get incredibly defensive, and change the subject.

I've also tried, and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight. A few years back, I got into golfing (after years of making fun of my parents), and started WW at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks. But I would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family, or even mentioning I was doing it. Given I'm the cook in the house, it didn't lead to good, sustaining results. This accountability problem didn't just lie with how I interacted with my family, heck, my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups, and given my family has a long history of diabetes, and some heart disease, it was incredibly irresponsible. I'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen. I'd always push my reminders out a few months until ""I'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment."".

A few months back, I realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise I was getting at work, and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair, a few hours with the family, and then a few hours watching TV or back to work. My sleeping patterns were messed up because I'd choose to fall asleep on the couch, setting my alarm for \~5am to then go up to bed, so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her (no sleep apnea, but boy, I can be a trumpet). My back is shot, I can barely walk straight, and am in constant pain. I'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body. The thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to ""normal"" is both exciting, but also agonizing. No more excuses to do absolutely nothing.

While my depression has always been fairly mild, I've lost family members to suicide, and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends. But hey, if I died from a heart attack, would that be so bad? I felt like I hit rock bottom. 

I know it sounds dumb, but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time, I was seeking help, and that while I knew she meant well, I needed her to give me some room here. I'd tried keto a few times for short periods of time, and it suits me well in general as I'm not really a carbs person anyhow (but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult...). I decided to bite the bullet, and sign up to Virta Health, buy a peloton, and say screw it - I'll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while, but I know I'll be better. Two things that work with me: accountability and gamification. Virta holds me accountable. No hiding, the coach is on you daily, everything's measured. It forced me to go to the dr and get results (and I'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken, my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high, but below any problematic numbers... Peloton, once I get started, gamifies things. I started on Duolingo learning Japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it, and not only kept going regardless of what was going on, but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to Japan. All that because of that damn streak :)

I know all of this is irrelevant to all of you, but honestly, /r/keto has been an inspiration for the last few years, and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started. This is just the beginning, but I wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that I'm sure I'll fall off of, but get back on again. I owe it to myself, and my amazing family.

keto,mfhjup,TeaCatt,Doctor was Impressed,"So about five weeks ago, I went to the doctor, and received my first official diagnosis of diabetes.  I had had problems having healthcare prior to now, and was able to get it in January, after not having it for a long time, but I suspected that was the case for some time now.

After 5 weeks, I went back for a follow-up.  My A1C1 is down 2 entire points in only 5 weeks, with keto (15 lbs weight loss) and metformin.  It's almost at normal range, and is *currently* normal, based on my blood glucose tests.  The A1C1 will assuredly go down some more in a couple months after the metformin and keto have been doing their stuff in synergy.  My doctor was impressed.  I have never seen a doctor be so perky and delighted!  He told me to keep up the good work, and complimented me three or four times.  I wasn't even sure how to take that much praise lol.  He also said he thought I could reverse my diabetes, get off of the metformin, and should strive for that.  Lucky break there, getting the doctor who knows this is possible, and doesn't just treat it like it's a done deal!

I hope this story, however simple, helps other people see how good this way of eating can be.  I know the doctor is right, and I'm going to keep on fighting for my life and *quality* of life.  I knew diabetes was bad, but I didn't know some of the things the doctor informed me about.  It's REALLY easy to realize now, that a lot of my health nags are from the diabetes.  I can do this and so can all of you.  If anyone needs a support buddy, I'm open to that.  I could probably use a few people to talk to, too.  Will happily trade non-reddit messengers.

I moved and a lot of life stuff changed and I got back up to 295 and about a month ago I started in on keto again and about a week after(starting 03/04) I started exercising.

Current weight 189.6

After I had my daughter in August 2019 I thought the baby weight would fall off as soon as I went back to work (Registered Nurse, on feet all day). Boy, was I better.

I spent the first few months battling PPD and post partum hypertension.

I went back to work carry most of my pregnancy weight. Cue the start of the pandemic last May. I sent my daughter to live with my dad who has multiple ailments because my husband and I are both nurses- him in a hospital and I in long term care. My father normally babysits my daughter a few days a week for us and getting her every day would put him at risk.

I was the most depressed I had ever been at that point. I missed my 6 month old more than anything but the pandemic was new and we were all afraid. I missed her first Easter and nearly milestones for the month she was with my dad. I couldn't take it. I gorged.

Taking her back a month later was terrifying but thankfully we all stayed healthy at the time (I recently had covid- mild for me at least. Other family members did not fair as well). It was then I realized I needed to do better for myself and for her.

I started with 16:8 intermittent fasting to get my over eating under control and then bridged to keto. I'm happy to say I'm 40 lbs and one chin less at this point and my outlook has never been neyyer.",2348758,1616983986,2021-03-29 10:13:06,2079658,6,1
keto,mff1mh,Flydude787,Keto in Japan - hard but improving,"Hey keto heroes, just wondering if anyone lives in Japan and doing Keto at the same time. I have been doing Keto for a few months and finding it's challenging to buy any food from a restaurant as keto-friendly. The Japanese people crazily into sugar. Everything, almost everything, adds a lot of sugar. Even some foods are labeled “low card,” they still contain 10-20g net carbs in a small serve. The only way to do this for me is to cook at home every day. When I go to work, I have to bring my food. But somehow im getting used to it. It's also not that good once your friends call you to dine out, but still, people around you are getting used to the fact that you are a picky mouth. 😂 So, good to live in Japan to have some excellent quality wagyu beef and all kinds of fresh fatty fish, but a low carb diet still has a long way to go here.",2348735,1616982276,2021-03-29 09:44:36,2081368,7,1

I stayed the same weight the past couple weeks without any significant change to exercise or diet.  They say weightloss is nonlinear.  It becomes amplified as you get closer to goal.

I am even excited... EXCITED, for my annual physical checkup next week.  I never thought I would say that.  Before I put off annual checkups because I loathed the inevitable lecture about how I should try to lose some weight.  Almost ashamed at what I had done to my body...Not anymore!!

My runners knee pain has been on and off but the weather finally broke and I have been biking a few times a week.  I also picked up some resistance bands to work on building up muscles that don't get used very much running.  My knee has already started feeling better by focusing on low impact exercise.

I bumped up my macros closer to maintenance last week and wow. It's a ton of food.  I'll be bumping all the way up to maintenance tomorrow.  Then somehow figure out an accurate way to account for exercise calories.  I rarely ate into them during my initial weight loss period.  I will probably just eat half of what fitbit says the exercise was and adjust as required.  Seems to be a popular method.

Thank you again to everyone that takes the time to share their knowledge, trials, and inspiration on this sub.  It helped me (and my wife) a lot!

keto,mfc7kf,VixenAlert,Some NSV’s to stay positive,"Hi all. After an emotionally draining week of family drama and funeral events...its hitting me hard. I haven’t fell off my diet or really felt like cheating...but mentally I’m running low. Self-esteem and motivation are in the gutter and I’m feeling super self-critical. Hormones are a trip. I decided to make a list of NSV’s to stay positive and keep this this keto train going. 

1. Out of all the causes of stress earlier this week, getting dressed was NOT one of them! Getting dressed up fancier than normal is usually dreadful and just uncomfortable, especially if I’m wearing a dress. This time...it wasn’t even a thought. Everything just fit and fit well. Brought the stress level down a ton. 

2. M/L size stockings no longer make me feel like suffocating. They don’t make me look like a stuffed sausage or leave a horrible red itchy mark on my stomach for hours after taking them off. Tbh, this may have been because I could never admit my size😅. They seem to be not catching runs either because of the lesser amount of stretch. Woo! 

3. Regular width flats no longer give me sharp pains on my feet. I never wear certain shoes because I have bad feet/bunions. Particular styles (like flats) I have to go for the wide choice and even then I never buy them. Holy moly! I’m still the same size 8 but now I can wear this regular width shoe with little problem?? I bought these sleek, kind of narrow looking flats. Who am I? My feet shrank! 

4. I’m no longer sweating (even with a mask) when I do a simple task like going to take the dogs out and chatting with neighbors. This one really bothered me before and it was soo awkward. Something about the mix of being overweight, overheating, and being self conscious would make me sweat (my face in particular) as soon as I leave my home or have to converse with someone. I would literally cut conversation short to run off. If it’s a makeup day, double whammy. I used to chalk this up to anxiety. Welp, no. I was just fat. Now I’m easy breezy lemon squeezey! Hell, I even get cold sometimes. 

5. I’m finding it much easier to track my monthly cycle and symptoms on keto. When I ate all the carbs and whatever I wanted, it was always so difficult to know where pain, inflammation, stomach aches, etc was coming from. Bloated and feel like shit, well is it the whole pizza I ate last night or is ovulation early? Short tempered with a headache, is it the crash from the sugary danishes or is shark week coming? These questions are so simplified for me now because my diet is on point and I know how keto makes me feel, so it’s easier to track outside symptoms. As a woman, this makes me feel really good knowing my body. 

When you’re feeling low and life is kicking you in the behind...remember you’re making changes and doing the damn thing. 5 pounds or 50. It doesn’t matter. Every small victory counts. Please comment if you can think of any or just want to get something off your chest 😊🙏🏼. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, girls and boys. 21 lbs down and 19 lbs to go. KCKO! 

TL;DR: Getting dressed for events is easy. Stockings don’t make me feel like dying. My feet are smaller. I don’t sweat as much. I can track my feminine cycle and symptoms better.",2348640,1616972417,2021-03-29 07:00:17,2091227,7,2

keto,mfax22,rocksmithpro,Is there anything I can just... eat?,"Doing some research (and reading the FAQ) has provided me some more insight into Keto and I realize that I was introduced to this diet with incorrect information. It was pitched to me as ""if you limit your carbs, you can eat all the fats you need"". Specifically I was told I could eat all the bacon, steak, and chicken I wanted.

I'm starting to realize that isn't the case. If I'm trying to lose weight, I need to also limit my fat intake and do workouts. I appreciate this, and I'll try to adjust myself accordingly. Which means I can't just eat a pound of bacon with my eggs every morning, I suppose.

My problem is really that I'm used to just eating whenever I want and I'm trying to limit myself, but is there any thing out there I can just eat to satisfy the desire to eat? Like is there anything that doesn't need to be limited? If I get the desire to eat something at 10pm, can I snack on some mozzarella cheese? Some lettuce? Zucchini noodles? Boiled eggs?

I'd heard about it, and I like the idea of limiting myself to just a shake for nutrition to that is guaranteed to lose me weight. I won't have any reservations about if I'm eating too much, and I won't trick myself into eating four of those low carb tortillas that are way too easy to get a hold of. 

I was wondering if anyone else here has used it and if you have found a success with it. I'd love to know your thoughts. Thanks!",2348343,1616951743,2021-03-29 01:15:43,2111901,10,1

keto,mf3bt6,emstewie14,I’m just sick and tired of fighting an uphill battle...,"Hey all! Here really struggling and needing some encouragement. Maybe a keto buddy? I’m 34F, 5’7”, CW 202, GW 170, mom of 3 (9 yr, 5 yr &amp; 9 mo) with a husband working nights and away or sleeping most of the of the time. (I added the kids and husband to give you an idea of my daily life...not a single mom but it can feel like I am) Successfully did keto almost 2 years ago, lost 30 lbs, felt amazing. Got pregnant with the 3rd (yay!) but gained it all back and then some. I now work from home which has its pros and cons. I am having a *really* hard time going back to keto and sticking with it. A few reasons: 1) I’m so damn tired most of the time, struggling with off and on sleep issues with the baby 2) in a food rut? Nothing sounds good, ever so I tend to just eat easy crap 3) my husband’s off days are triggers cause he will go to the store and buy food that’s tempting/we finally all get to be together and relax which also leads to more relaxed eating 4) I’m an emotional eater so if I get an emotional trigger, it’s SO hard to fight 5) meal planning for my family and then myself separately is exhausting, I despise it, so I usually count myself out and just get what the rest of the family needs (I’m aware that I need to take care of myself but it doubles my “work” in preparing for the week so I just short change my own stuff)

We just invested in a home gym setup so I now get to do strength training when I can fit it in which is usually my lunch breaks. Having the flexibility to work it into my schedule is amazing. I know keto is the best option for my way of eating. I honestly think I have a carb intolerance, even incorporating a little here and there works against me. I have literally been fighting between 203-200 lbs for months and months. The lowest I’ve gotten is 197 and that lasted a day. Vacillating between these 3 lbs is making me inSANE and just want to sCrEaM. I already have my food logged for tomorrow, ready to start and having a plan helps, of course. 

And if I’m being honest, this not being *new* is working against me. The first time I did keto it was NEW and exciting and it was awesome. Now it’s like, oh ok, I know what I need to do but it’s not *exciting*. Does that make sense at all?? I would love to hear from anyone and everyone. I know how important this community was to me the first time around and I need to stay plugged in.

Being able to throw some cold cuts together in a minute and be eating is convenient, especially when you're working in IT and something is broken and you want to take a sandwich back to your desk.

A lot of stores in my area started to carry various ""low-carb"" wraps. I've used them, but I am always wary of items that claim that more than 50% of it's carb count is fiber.

I used to buy Joseph's Lavash Bread, but it seems everyone else in my area discovered it, and it's perpetually out of stock at my grocery store.

Last week, I was shopping at Aldi (no, Aldi does not carry Joseph's Lavash Bread) and found these interesting wraps:

**Crepini**

This is a very low carb wrap made from eggs and cauliflower. It is very thin and tears easily. You will probably want to use two at a time. It's spongy and has almost no taste. According to the package it has 0 TOTAL carbs.

**Crystal Farms Cheese Wraps**

keto,mf11j9,tmshortt,Keto and thyroid,"Has anyone here had a problem with keto and thyroid? I have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. For over 20 years now. It’s been very stable for the last 10. I’ve lost 30+ pounds on keto. Lately tho, I was getting really hungry, and losing my control. Also struggling with horrible insomnia, which made me of course, completely exhausted during the day. I was thinking it was perimenopause symptoms. 

Then my hands started shaking. I knew right away. Went and got lab work done, and sure enough I’m hyper. That means I’m getting too much thyroid hormone. This can cause insomnia, heart racing, hand shaking, increased appetite....lots of fun things...sometimes it takes me a hot minute to figure out that it is a thyroid hormone fluctuation. Especially now, because it’s been so stable for so long. 

Once before I lost weight, 100 pounds, on WW, and my levels went up. A lot! Which seems counter intuitive. You would think, lost weight, lower blood volume, you would need LESS hormone. Nope, needed more. 🤷‍♀️ but sometimes this stupid disease is annoying like that. But this time I wonder about the GF aspect of this diet. I had a friend who was diagnosed, went GF, and never had to go on meds. Citing the inflammatory nature of gluten. Hence my curiosity of could the GF aspect of keto be affecting the function of my thyroid. I can get an adjustment of medication, and The insomnia and other symptoms will dissipate, I know this, but I’m curious if anyone else on here has experienced this? Have thyroid disease, done keto, and had it affect you? Not eating gluten has been really good for me in so many ways, I really don’t want to go back to it.",2348177,1616936518,2021-03-28 21:01:58,2127126,8,1
keto,mf0p5j,LadyVonDrakensburg,My Keto Journey | How my quality of life has improved after just 5 weeks,"Sex: Female 
Age: 25
Height: 5ft 9""
SW: 204 lbs | CW: 190 lbs | GW: 150 lbs
Old Macros: 16g Carb | 105g Fat | 85g Protein | 1357 kcal
New Macros: 23g Carb | 68g Fat | 100g Protein | 1102 kcal
Intermittent Fasting: 16/8 (First meal at 11.30am, snack at 4pm, second meal at 7pm)

Hi everyone, I'm just 5 weeks into my keto journey, and swapped to my new macros just a few days ago so hopefully the weightloss improves - I'm still very happy with 14lbs though! I'm taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week, and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target. 

But weightloss aside, I wanted to share how keto has positively affected me, to try and encourage others to stick it out, even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride. 

Joint pain - As a young person, experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating. Before lockdown I went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week, but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside. I was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but I'd have to go in for further tests to confirm this. Since swapping to keto, my finger pain has disappeared entirely, and my knee pain is barely there. I really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation.

Spots / acne - In that same vein, the skin on my face has never been better. Whilst I only had mild acne on my cheeks, the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy, uneven, and red in places. The redness and spots have gone, and I cannot believe that the uneven texture I had, especially in places like my forehead where it's impossible to miss, has disappeared. 

Fat and water deposits - The first major change I experienced when I lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs. I use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance; not quite cellulite, but lumpy all the same. The skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone. I wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat?  

Bloating - Before keto I was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1) the food I was eating, and 2) a bad habit I had of swallowing air when I was hungry. Despite still drinking the likes of Coke Zero, I haven't experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto, and my better, more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit. 

Energy levels - I use to suffer from the post lunch slump and, as I'm currently working from home, would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work. When I was working in the office, this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and I'd be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work. Happy to say that I've shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto. I'm able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout. 

Brain fog - Likewise, my brain fog has gone. I struggled focussing on tasks, and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data (I create simulations for the oil and gas industry, so handle a lot of numbers). I feel like my mind is sharper now and I'm less likely to have my eyes ""glaze"" over. 

Mood - I suffer from stress and anxiety. Whether it's just down to making a positive impact in my life, or whether it's the diet itself, I can't remember the last time I felt this good. I feel happy, optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me, even before the phsyical weight has gone. For the first time in 7 years, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting myself back. 

Sleep - No more struggling to sleep. I'm getting a good, undisturbed night of sleep each night, and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times, to waking up before my alarm. 

Relationship with food - I hated food. I was a high carb snack eater because I hated preparing meals. Now I actually enjoy the process of researching what I'm going to make, getting creative with recipes, and then getting hands on with making it. Keto's restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food, and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes. 

Hopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others, so thanks for letting me share ☺️",2348160,1616935163,2021-03-28 20:39:23,2128481,24,1

1 avocado per day (100g) for potassium,

2 teaspoons salt per day in beef stock.

Water: 2 litres per day.
